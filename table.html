sanctity is thus known. We sacrifice to all) both males and females
whose (superiority is such).

(The Ratu speaks.) As an Ahu (revered and) to be chosen, he who is the Zaotar speaks
forth to me.
(The Zaotar.) So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned, speak
forth!

 - CHAPTER 8

<h4>OFFERING OF THE MEAT-OFFERING IN PARTICULAR. THE FAITHFUL PARTAKE.</h4>

1. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best.
It is weal; it is weal to this (man),
When toward Righteousness Best there is right.
I offer the Myazda (of the) meat-offering with a complete and
sacred offering; and I offer Haurvatatat (who guards the water),
and Ameretatat (who guards the plants and the wood), and the flesh
of the blessed Kine; and I offer the Haoma and the Haoma-juice,
the wood-billets and the perfume for the praise of Ahura Mazda,
and of the Ahuna-vairya, the veracious word, and for that of the
pious and beneficent Prayer for blessings, and for the redoubted
Curse of the wise, and for the praise of the Haoma, and of the
Mathra of the holy Zarathushtra; and may it come to us with sacred
fullness (to accept and to recompense our gift).

2. (The Ratu speaks.) Eat, O ye men, of this Myazda, the meat-offering,
ye who have deserved it by your righteousness and correctness.

3. O ye Bountiful Immortals, and thou, the Mazdayasnian law,
ye just men and just women, and ye Zaothras, whoever among these
Mazdayasnians would call himself a Mazdayasnian desiring to live
in the practice of the liberality of Righteousness [for by sorcery
the settlements of Righteousness are ruined], do ye cause (such
an one) to be (still further) taught<sup>1</sup>, (ye), who are the waters,
the plants, and the Zaothras!

   + NOTE: 1. Hum2 159 (mazdayasnO aoJanO aCah= rA+ma JIctayamnO):
  "pretending to be a Mazdayasnian (but) *hating (those
  who are) *dependent on truth"


4. And whoever of these Mazdayasnians, adults, when he invokes
with earnestness, does not adhere to these words, and (so) speaks,
he approaches to that (word) of the magician; (but, as against
that magician's word) 'a blessing is Righteousness (called) the
Best.'

5. May'st Thou, O Ahura Mazda! reign at Thy will, and with a
saving rule over Thine own creatures, and render Ye the holy (man)
also a sovereign at his will over waters, and over plants, and
over all the clean and sacred (creatures) which contain the seed
of Righteousness. Strip ye the wicked of all power!<sup>2</sup>

   + NOTE: 2. Hum2 90 (xCayamnem aCavanem dAyata axCayamnem drva#tem):
  "cause You the truthful one to be in control (of himself),
  the deceitful one not to be in control (of himself)"


6. Absolute in power may the holy be, bereft of all free choice
the wicked ! Gone (may he be), met as foe, carried out from the
creatures of Spenta Mainyu, hemmed in without power over any wish!
<hr width="25%">

7. I will incite, even I who am Zarathushtra, the heads of the
houses, villages, Zantus, and provinces, to the careful following
of this Religion which is that of Ahura, and according to Zarathushtra,
in their thoughts, their words, and their deeds.<sup>3</sup>
</td> + NOTE: 3. Hum2 183 (haxCaya ... fratem& ... ai*h@ da%nay@ anumataya%ja
   anuxtaya%ja anuvarctaya%ja): "I would spur on the authorities
   ... to follow this religion with thoughts, word, and actions"


8. I pray for the freedom and glory of the entire existence of
the holy (man) while I bless it, and I pray for the repression
and shame of the entire existence of the wicked.

9. Ashem Vohu ... (3).

Propitiation to Haoma who brings righteousness (to us) for
sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise. (The Zaotar?)
As the Ahu to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar speaks forth
to me. (The Ratu.) As an Ahu to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar
speaks forth to me. (The Zaotar.) So let the Ratu from his Righteousness,
holy and learned, speak forth!


 - CHAPTER 9

 <h2>THE HOM YASHT</h2>

1. At the hour of Havani, Haoma came to Zarathushtra, as he served
the (sacred) Fire, and sanctified (its flame), while he sang aloud
the Gathas. And Zarathushtra asked him: Who art thou, O honorable one<sup>1</sup>! who art
of all the incarnate world the most beautiful in Thine own body of those
whom I have, seen, (thou) glorious [immortal]?

   + NOTE: 1. So Hum2 138; Mills has 'O man'.


2. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, the holy one who driveth death
afar: I am, O Zarathushtra Haoma, the holy and driving death afar;
pray to me, O Spitama, prepare me for the taste. Praise me so that
also the other Saoshyants [benefactors] may praise me<sup>2</sup>.


   + NOTE: 2. So Hum2 74. Mills reads. 'Praise toward
  me in (Thy) praises as the other [Saoshyants] praise.'


3. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Unto Haoma be the praise. What
man, O Haoma! first prepared thee for the corporeal world? What
award<sup>3</sup> was offered him? what gain did he acquire?


   + NOTE: 3. (ashish) Mills relates Ashi to Asha and reads 'blessedness'.


4. Thereupon did Haoma answer me, he the holy one, and driving
death afar: Vivanghvant was the first of men who prepared me for
the incarnate world. This award<sup>4</sup> was offered him; this gain
did he acquire, that to him was born a son who was Yima, called
the brilliant, (he of the many flocks, the most glorious of those
yet born, the sunlike-one of men), that he made from his authority
both herds and people free from dying, both plants and waters
free from drought, and men could eat inexhaustible<sup>5</sup> food.


   + NOTE: 4. Mills: 'blessedness'.
  5. So Malandra, Mills reads 'imperishable'.


5. In the reign of brave<sup>6</sup> Yima was there neither cold
nor heat, there was neither age nor death, nor envy demon-made.
Like teenagers<sup>7</sup> walked the two forth, son and father, in
their stature and their form, so long as Yima, son of Vivanghvant
ruled, he of the many herds!


   + NOTE: 6. (Yimahe xshathre aurvahe) So Malandra, Mills reads 'swift of motion'.
  Wolff reads 'Herrschaft' (cf B542).
  7. Mills: 'fifteen-yearlings'.


6. Who was the second man, O Haoma! who prepared thee for the
corporeal world? What award<sup>8</sup> was offered him? what gain did
he acquire?


   + NOTE: 8. Mills: 'sanctity'.


7. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, he the holy one, and driving
death afar: Athwya was the second who prepared-me for the corporeal
world. This award<sup>9</sup> was given him, this gain did he acquire,
that to him a son was born, Thraetaona of the mighty clan<sup>10</sup>,


   + NOTE: 9. Mills: 'blessedness'.
  10. (vîsô sûrayau) Following Gershevitch.
  Mills reads 'heroic tribe'.  Malandra reads 'mighty house'.


8. Who smote Azhi Dahaka<sup>11</sup>, three-jawed and triple-headed,
six-eyed, with thousand perceptions<sup>12</sup>, and of mighty strength, a lie-demon
[druj] of the Daevas, evil for our settlements, and wicked, whom the
evil spirit Angra Mainyu made as the most mighty Druj [against
the corporeal world], and for the murder of (our) settlements,
and to slay the (homes) of Asha!


   + NOTE: 11. Mills: 'the dragon Dahaka'.
  12. (hazanrâ-yaoxshtîm) Mills: 'thousand powers'.


9. Who was the third man, O Haoma! who prepared thee for the
corporeal world? What award<sup>13</sup> was given him? what gain did
he acquire?


   + NOTE: 13. Mills: 'blessedness'.


10. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, the holy one, and driving death
afar: Thrita, [the most helpful of the Samids], was the third man
who prepared me for the corporeal world. This award was
given him, this gain did he acquire, that to him two son were
born, Urvakhshaya and Keresaspa, the one a judge confirming order,
the other a youth of great ascendant, curly-haired<sup>14</sup>, bludgeon-bearing.


   + NOTE: 14. Mills: 'blessedness'.
  15. Mills: 'ringlet-headed'.


11. He who smote the horny dragon swallowing men, and swallowing
horses, poisonous, and green of color over which, as thick as
thumbs are, greenish poison flowed aside, on whose back once Keresaspa
cooked his meat in iron caldron at the noonday meal; and the deadly,
scorched, upstarted, and springing off, dashed out the water as
it boiled. Headlong fled affrighted manly-minded Keresaspa.

12. Who was the fourth man who prepared thee, O Haoma! for the
corporeal world? What blessedness was given him? what gain did
he acquire?

13. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, he the holy, and driving death
afar: Pourushaspa was the fourth man who prepared me for the corporeal
world. This blessedness was given him, this gain did he acquire,
that thou, O Zarathushtra! wast born to him, the just, in Pourushaspa's
house, the Daeva's foe, the friend of Mazda's lore, (14) famed
in Airyana Vaejah; and thou, O Zarathushtra! didst recite the
first the Ahuna-vairya, four times intoning it, and with verses
kept apart [(Pazand) each time with louder and still louder voice].

15. And thou didst cause, O Zarathushtra! all the demon-gods to
vanish in the ground who aforetime flew about this earth in human
shape (and power. This hast thou done), thou who hast been the
strongest, and the staunchest, the most active, and the swiftest,
and (in every deed) the most victorious in the two spirits' world.

16. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma. Good is Haoma,
and the well-endowed, exact and righteous in its nature, and good
inherently, and healing, beautiful of form, and good in deed,
and most successful in its working, golden-hued, with bending
sprouts. As it is the best for drinking, so (through its sacred
stimulus) is it the most nutritious for the soul.

17. I make my claim on thee, O yellow one! for inspiration. I
make my claim on thee for strength; I make my claim on thee for
victory; I make my claim on thee for health and healing (when
healing is my need); I make my claim on thee for progress and
increased prosperity, and vigor of the entire frame, and for understanding,
of each adorning kind, and for this, that I may have free course
among our settlements, having power where I will, overwhelming
angry malice, and a conqueror of lies.

18. Yea, I make my claim on thee that I may overwhelm the angry
hate of haters, of the Daevas and of mortals, of the sorcerers
and sirens, of the tyrants, and the Kavis, of the Karpans, murderous
bipeds, of the sanctity-destroyers, the profane apostate bipeds,
of the wolves four-footed monsters, of the invading host, wide-fronted,
which with stratagems advance.

19. This first blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that
drivest death afar! I beseech of thee for (heaven), the best life
of the saints, the radiant, all-glorious.
This second blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest
death afar! this body's health (before that blest life is attained).

This third blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest
death afar! the long vitality of life.

20. This fourth blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that
drivest death afar! that I may stand forth on this earth with
desires gained, and powerful, receiving satisfaction, overwhelming
the assaults of hate, and conquering the lie.
This fifth blessing, O Haoma, I beseech of thee, thou that drivest
death afar! that I may stand victorious on earth, conquering in
battles, overwhelming the assaults of hate, and conquering the
lie.

21. This sixth blessing I ask of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest
death afar! that we may get good warning of the thief, good warning
of the murderer, see first the bludgeon-bearer, get first sight
of the wolf. May no one whichsoever get first the sight of us.
In the strife with each may we be they who get the first alarm!

22. Haoma grants to racers who would run a course with span both
speed and bottom (in their horses). Haoma grants to women come
to bed with child a brilliant offspring and a righteous line.

Haoma grants to those (how many!) who have long sat searching
books, more knowledge and more wisdom.

23. Haoma grants to those long maidens, who sit at home unwed,
good husbands, and that as soon as asked, he Haoma, the well-minded.

24. Haoma lowered Keresani, dethroned him from his throne, for
he grew so fond of power, that he treacherously said: No priest
behind (and watching) shall walk the lands for me, as a counselor
to prosper them, he would rob everything of progress, he would
crush the growth of all!

25. Hail to thee, O Haoma, who hast power as thou wilt, and by
thine inborn strength! Hail to thee, thou art well-versed in many
sayings, and true and holy words. Hail to thee for thou dost ask
no wily questions, but questionest direct.

26. Forth hath Mazda borne to thee, the star-bespangled girdle,
the spirit-made, the ancient one, the Mazdayasnian Faith.
So with this thou art begirt on the summits of the mountains,
for the spreading of the precepts, and the headings of the Mathra,
(and to help the Mathra's teacher),

27. O Haoma, thou house-lord, and thou clan-lord, thou tribe-lord,
and chieftain of the land, and thou successful learned teacher,
for aggressive strength I speak to thee, for that which smites
with victory, and for my body's saving, and for manifold delight!

28. Bear off from us the torment and the malice of the hateful.
Divert the angry foe's intent!
What man soever in this house is violent and wicked, what man
soever in this village, or this tribe, or province, seize thou
away the fleetness from his feet; throw thou a veil of darkness
o'er his mind; make thou his intellect (at once) a wreck!

29. Let not the man who harms us, mind or body, have power to
go forth on both his legs, or hold with both his hands, or see
with both his eyes, not the land (beneath his feet), or the herd
before his face.

30. At the aroused and fearful Dragon, green, and belching forth
his poison, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma,
hurl thy mace!
At the (murderous) bludgeon-bearer, committing deeds unheard of,
blood-thirsty, (drunk) with fury, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!

31. Against the wicked human tyrant, hurling weapons at the head,
for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy
mace!
Against the righteousness-disturber, the unholy life-destroyer,
thoughts and words of our religion well-delivering, yet in actions
never reaching, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow
Haoma, hurl thy mace!

32. Against the body of the harlot, with her magic minds o'erthrowing
with (intoxicating) pleasures, to the lusts her person offering,
whose mind as vapor wavers as it flies before the wind, for the
righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!

 - CHAPTER 10

1. Let the Demon-gods and Goddesses fly far away from hence,
and let the good Sraosha make here his home! [And may the good
Blessedness here likewise dwell], and may she here spread delight
and peace within this house, Ahura's, which is sanctified by Haoma,
bringing righteousness (to all).

2. At the first force of thy pressure, O intelligent! I praise
thee with my voice, while I grasp at first thy shoots. At thy
next pressure, O intelligent! I praise thee with my voice, when
as with full force of a man I crush thee down.

3. I praise the cloud that waters thee, and the rains which make
thee grow on the summits of the mountains; and I praise thy lofty
mountains where the Haoma branches spread.

4. This wide earth do I praise, expanded far (with paths), the
productive, the full bearing, thy mother, holy plant! Yea, I praise
the lands where thou dost grow, sweet-scented, swiftly spreading,
the good growth of the Lord. O Haoma, thou growest on the mountains,
apart on many paths, and there still may'st thou flourish. The
springs of Righteousness most verily thou art, (and the fountains
of the ritual find their source in thee)!

5. Grow (then) because I pray to thee on all thy stems and branches,
in all thy shoots (and tendrils) increase thou through my word!

6. Haoma grows while he is praised, and the man who praises him
is therewith more victorious. The lightest pressure of thee, Haoma,
thy feeblest praise, the slightest tasting of thy juice, avails
to the thousand-smiting of the Daevas.

7. Wasting doth vanish from that house, and-with it foulness,
whither in verity they bear thee, and where thy praise in truth
is sung, the drink of Haoma, famed, health-bringing (as thou art).
[(Pazand) to his village and abode they bear him.]

8. All other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody
spear, but Haoma's stirring power goes hand in hand with friendship.
[Light is the drunkenness of Haoma (Pazand).]
Who as a tender son caresses Haoma, forth to the bodies of such
persons Haoma comes to heal.

9. Of all the healing virtues, Haoma, whereby thou art a healer,
grant me some. Of all the victorious powers, whereby thou art
a victor, grant me some. A faithful praiser will I be to thee,
O Haoma, and a faithful praiser (is) a better (thing) than Righteousness
the Best; so hath the Lord, declaring (it), decreed.

10. Swift and wise hath the well-skilled Deity created thee; swift
and wise on high Haraiti did He, the well-skilled, plant thee.

11. And taught (by implanted instinct) on every side, the bounteous
birds have carried thee to the Peaks-above-the-eagles, to the
mount's extremest summit, to the gorges and abysses, to the heights
of many pathways, to the snow-peaks ever whitened.

12. There, Haoma, on the ranges dost thou grow of many kinds.
Now thou growest of milky whiteness, and now thou growest golden;
and forth thine healing liquors flow for the inspiring of the
pious. So terrify away from me the (death's) aim of the curser.
So terrify and crush his thought who stands as my maligner.

13. Praise be to thee, O Haoma, (for he makes the poor man's thoughts
as great as any of the richest whomsoever.) Praise be to Haoma,
(for he makes the poor man's thoughts as great as when mind reacheth
culmination.) With manifold retainers dost thou, O Haoma, endow
the man who drinks thee mixed with milk; yea, more prosperous
thou makest him, and more endowed with mind.

14. Do not vanish from me suddenly like milk-drops in the rain;
let thine exhilarations go forth ever vigorous and fresh; and
let them come to me with strong effect. Before thee, holy Haoma,
thou bearer of the ritual truth, and around thee would I cast
this body, a body which (as all) may see (is fit for gift and)
grown.

15. I renounce with vehemence the murderous woman's emptiness,
the Jaini's, hers, with intellect dethroned. She vainly thinks
to foil us, and would beguile both Fire-priest and Haoma; but
she herself, deceived therein, shall perish. And when she sits
at home, and wrongly eats of Haoma's offering, priest's mother
will that never make her, nor give her holy sons!

16. To five do I belong, to five others do I not; of the good
thought am I, of the evil am I not; of the good word am I, of
the evil am I not; of the good deed am I, and of the evil, not.

To Obedience am I given, and to deaf disobedience, not; to the
saint do I belong, and to the wicked, not; and so from this on
till the ending shall be the spirits' parting. (The two shall
here divide.)

17. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma, Mazda-made.
Good is Haoma, Mazda-made. All the plants of Haoma praise I, on
the heights of lofty mountains, in the gorges of the valleys,
in the clefts (of sundered hill-sides) cut for the bundles bound
by women. From the silver cup I pour Thee to the golden chalice
over. Let me not thy (sacred) liquor spill to earth, of precious
cost.

18. These are thy Gathas, holy Haoma, these thy songs, and these
thy teachings, and these thy truthful ritual words, health-imparting,
victory-giving, from harmful hatred healing giving.

19. These and thou art mine, and forth let thine exhilarations
flow; bright and sparkling let them hold on their (steadfast)
way; for light are thine exhilaration(s), and flying lightly come
they here. Victory-giving smiteth Haoma, victory-giving is it
worshipped; with this Gathic word we praise it.

20. Praise to the Kine; praise and victory (be) spoken to her!
Food for the Kine, and pasture! 'For the Kine let thrift use toil;
yield thou us food.'

21. We worship the yellow lofty one; we worship Haoma who causes
progress, who makes the settlements advance; we worship Haoma
who drives death afar; yea, we worship all the Haoma plants. And
we worship (their) blessedness, and the Fravashi of Zarathushtra
Spitama, the saint.

 - CHAPTER 11

<h4>PRELUDE TO THE HAOMA-OFFERING.</h4>

1. Three clean creatures (full of blessings) curse betimes while
yet invoking, the cow, the horse, and then Haoma. The cow cries
to her driver thus: Childless be thou, shorn of offspring evil-famed,
and slander-followed, who foddered fairly dost not use me, but
fattenest me for wife or children, and for thy niggard selfish
meal.

2. The horse cries to his rider thus: Be not spanner of the racers;
stretch no coursers to full-speed; do not stride across the fleetest,
thou, who dost not pray me swiftness in the meeting thick with
numbers, in the circuit thronged with men.

3. Haoma speaks his drinker thus: Childless be thou, shorn of
offspring, evil-famed, and slander-followed, who holdest me from
full outpouring, as a robber, skulls in-crushing. No head-smiter
am I ever, holy Haoma, far from death.

4. Forth my father gave an offering, tongue and left eye chose
Ahura, set apart for Haoma's meal.

5. Who this offering would deny me, eats himself, or prays it
from me, this which Mazda gave to bless me, tongue with left eye
(as my portion).

6. In his house is born no fire-priest, warrior ne'er in chariot
standing, never more the thrifty tiller. In his home be born Dahakas,
Murakas of evil practice, doing deeds of double nature.

7. Quick, cut off then Haoma's portion, gift of flesh for doughty
Haoma! Heed lest Haoma bind thee fettered, as he bound the fell
Turanian Frangrasyan (the murderous robber) fast in iron close-surrounded
in the mid-third of this earth!

8. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma made by Mazda,
good is Haoma Mazda-made.

9. Who to us is one hereupon to thee (becomes) two, to be made
to three, for the five-making of the four, for the seven-making
of the sixth, who are your nine in the decade (?), who serve you
and with zeal.

10. To thee, O holy Haoma! bearer of the ritual sanctity, I offer
this my person which is seen (by all to be) mature, (and fit for
gift); to Haoma the effective do I offer it, and to the sacred
exhilaration which he bestows; and do thou grant to me (for this),
O holy Haoma! thou that drivest death afar, (Heaven) the best
world of the saints, shining, all brilliant.

11. (The Ashem Vohu, &c.)

12-15. May'st Thou rule at Thy will, O Lord....(Repeat Y8.5-7)!

16. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian of Zarathushtra's order.

17. I celebrate my praises for good thoughts, good words, and
good deeds for my thoughts, my speeches, and (my) actions. With
chanting praises I present all good thoughts, good words, and
good deeds, and with rejection I repudiate all evil thoughts,
and words, and deeds. 18. Here I give to you, O ye Bountiful Immortals!
sacrifice and homage with the mind, with words, deeds, and my
entire person; yea, (I offer) to you the flesh of my very body
(as your own). And I praise Righteousness. A blessing is Righteousness
(called) the Best, &c.

 - CHAPTER 12. The Zoroastrian Creed


  + NOTE:  <a href="../copyright.htm">Translation of this chapter by Joseph H Peterson,
  copyright © 1997 by Joseph H. Peterson. All rights reserved.</a>

  This creed probably dates
  to the earliest days of the faith, but seems to have undergone
  some linguistic shift and subsequent recasting in the Old Avestan
  dialect. It was probably intended to be recited before an open
  assembly. See discussion in Boyce, <i>Zoroastrianism
  - Its Antiquity and Constant Vigour,</i> (Costa Mesa, Mazda Pub, 1992, p. 84 and 10. ff). The last phrase of verse 7, plus all of verses 8 and 9, are
  incorporated into the daily <a href="../ritual/ritualk.htm">Kusti ritual</a>.


1. I curse the Daevas.
I declare myself a Mazda-worshipper, a supporter of Zarathushtra,
hostile to the Daevas, fond of Ahura's teaching, a praiser of
the Amesha Spentas, a worshipper of the Amesha Spentas. I ascribe
all good to Ahura Mazda, 'and all the best,' Asha-endowed,
splendid, xwarena-endowed, whose is the cow, whose is Asha, whose
is the light, 'may whose blissful areas be filled with light'.

2. I choose the good Spenta Armaiti for myself; let her be mine.
I renounce the theft and robbery of the cow, and the damaging
and plundering of the Mazdayasnian settlements.

3. I want freedom of movement and freedom of dwelling for those
with homesteads, to those who dwell upon this earth with their
cattle. With reverence for Asha, and (offerings) offered up, I
vow this: I shall nevermore damage or plunder the Mazdayasnian
settlements, even if I have to risk life and limb.

4. I reject the authority of the Daevas, the wicked, no-good,
lawless, evil-knowing, the most druj-like of beings, the foulest
of beings, the most damaging of beings. I reject the Daevas and
their comrades, I reject the demons (yatu) and their comrades;
I reject any who harm beings. I reject them with my thoughts,
words, and deeds. I reject them publicly.

 Even as I reject the head (authorities), so too do I reject
the hostile followers of the druj.

5. As Ahura Mazda taught Zarathushtra at all discussions, at
all meetings, at which Mazda and Zarathushtra conversed;

6. as Ahura Mazda taught Zarathushtra at all discussions, at
all meetings, at which Mazda and Zarathushtra conversed — even
as Zarathushtra rejected the authority of the Daevas, so I also
reject, as Mazda-worshipper and supporter of Zarathushtra, the
authority of the Daevas, even as he, the Asha-endowed Zarathushtra,
has rejected them.

7. As the belief of the waters, the belief of the plants, the
belief of the well-made (Original) Cow; as the belief of Ahura
Mazda who created the cow and the Asha-endowed Man; as the belief
of Zarathushtra, the belief of Kavi Vishtaspa, the belief of both
Frashaostra and Jamaspa; as the belief of each of the Saoshyants
(saviors) — fulfilling destiny and Asha-endowed —

so I am a Mazda-worshipper
of this belief and teaching.

8. I profess myself a Mazda-worshipper, a Zoroastrian, having
vowed it and professed it. I pledge myself to the well-thought
thought, I pledge myself to the well-spoken word, I pledge myself
to the well-done action.

9. I pledge myself to the Mazdayasnian religion, which causes
the attack to be put off and weapons put down; [which upholds khvaetvadatha],
Asha-endowed; which of all religions that exist or shall be, is the greatest,
the best, and the most beautiful: Ahuric, Zoroastrian. I ascribe all good to
Ahura Mazda.
This is the creed of the Mazdayasnian religion.

 - CHAPTER 13


  + NOTE:  INVOCATIONS AND DEDICATIONS.
  Y13.1-6 and the beginning of 7 is in the Old Avesta dialect.


1. I address (my invocation to) Ahura Mazda. And I invoke (among
guardian beings) the chief of the house-lord, and the chief of
the Vis-lord, and the chief of the Zantu-lord. And I invoke the
chief of the province-lord. And the chief of women I invoke, the
Mazdayasnian Faith, the blessed and good Parendi, her who is the
holy one of human-kind. And I invoke this (holy) earth which bears
us.

2. And I invoke the friendly and most helpful person's lord,
the Fire of Ahura Mazda, and also the most energetic lords of
holy men, those who are most strenuous in their care of cattle
and the fields, and the chief of the thrifty tiller of the earth.
And I invoke the steady settler of sanctity, (and) the chief of
the charioteer.

3. And I invoke the chief of the fire-priest by means of the
most imposing sciences of the Mazdayasnian Faith. And I invoke
the chief of the Atharvan, and his pupils I invoke; yea, the lords
of each of them. I invoke these lords, and I summon the Bountiful
Immortals here, and the Prophets who shall serve us, the wisest
as they are, the most scrupulous in their exactness (as) they
utter words (of doctrine and of service), the most devoted (to
their duties likewise), and the most glorious in their thoughts(?).
And I invoke the most imposing forces of the Mazdayasnian Faith,
and the fire-priests I invoke, and the charioteers, the warriors,
and the thrifty tillers of the soil.

4. And to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! Ye who rule aright,
and dispose (of all) aright, I offer the flesh of my very frame,
and all the blessings of my life.
<hr width="33%">

Thus the two spirits thought, thus they spoke, and thus they did;

5. And therefore as Thou, O Ahura Mazda! didst think, speak,
dispose, and do all things good (for us), so to Thee would we
give, so would we assign to Thee our homage; so would we worship
Thee with our sacrifices. So would we bow before Thee with these
gifts, and so direct our prayers to Thee with confessions of our
debt.

6. By the kinship of the good kindred, by that of Righteousness
the good (Thy righteous servant's nature) would we approach Thee,
and by that of the good thrift-law, and of Piety the good.

7. And we would worship the Fravashi of the Kine of blessed gift,
and that of the holy Gaya Mareyan [Gayomard], and we would worship the holy
Fravashi of Zarathushtra Spitama, the saint. Yea, that one of
beings do we worship whose better (service) in the sacrifice Ahura
Mazda knows; (even those women do we worship) whose (better service
thus is known). Yea, both (holy) men and women (do we worship
whom Ahura Mazda knows).
As the Ahu is excelling....
A blessing is the Right called the best....

8. We worship the Ahuna-vairya; and we worship Asha Vahishta
the best(?), the bountiful Immortal. And we sacrifice to the Ha
fraoreti, even to the confession and laudation of the Mazdayasnian
Faith!

 - CHAPTER 14

 + NOTE: DEDICATIONS.


1. I will come to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! as a praiser
and a priest, and an invoker and sacrificer, as a memorizing reciter
and a chanter, for Your sacrifice and homage, which are to be
offered to You, the Bountiful Immortals, and for our dedication
and sanctification; (yea, for ours) who are the holy prophets
(destined to benefit the saints).

2. And to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! would I dedicate the
flesh of my very body, and all the blessings of a prospered life.

3. In this Zaothra with this Baresman, I desire to approach the
holy Yazads with my praise, and all the holy lords of the ritual
order at their times, Havani at his time, and Savanghi and Visya
at their times. 4. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian, and of Zarathushtra's
order.

5. The Zaotar speaks: As an Ahu (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar
(?) speaks forth to me (?).
The Ratu speaks: As an Ahu (revered and) to be chosen, the Zaotar
speaks forth to me.
The Zaotar: So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned,
speak forth!

 - CHAPTER 15

 + NOTE: THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES.


1. With precept, praise, and with delight produced by grace,
I call upon the Bountiful Immortals the good, and also therewith
the beautiful by name; and I sacrifice to them with the blessing
of the good ritual, with the earnest blessings of the good Mazdayasnian
Faith.

2. Whose best gift from his Righteousness is mine in the offering
Ahura this knoweth; who have lived, and live ever, by their names
these I worship, while I draw near with praises. The Good Kingdom
is to be chosen, that lot which most of all bears on (our blessings).

3. Let Sraosha (Obedience) be here present for the sacrifice
of Ahura Mazda, the most beneficent, the holy, who is so dear
to us as at the first, so at the last; yea, let him be present
here.

4. As the Ahu (revered and) to be chosen, the Atarevakhsha thus
speaks forth to me.
(Response): So let the Ratu from his righteousness, holy and learned,
speak forth!

 - CHAPTER 16


  + NOTE:  THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES WITH INCREASED FULLNESS OF EXPRESSION.

1. We worship Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order,
who disposes (all) aright, the greatest Yazad, who is also the
most beneficent, and the one who causes the settlements to advance,
the creator of good creatures; yea, we worship Him with these
offered Zaothras and with truthfully and scrupulously delivered
words; and we worship every holy Yazad of the heaven (as well)!

2. And we worship Zarathushtra Spitama in our sacrifice, the
holy lord of the ritual order with these Zaothras and with faithfully
delivered words; and we worship every holy earthly Yazad as we
worship him; and we worship also the Fravashi of Zarathushtra
Spitama, the saint. And we worship the utterances of Zarathushtra
and his religion, his faith and his lore.

3. And we worship the former religions of the world devoted to
Righteousness which were instituted at the creation, the holy
religions of the Creator Ahura Mazda, the resplendent and glorious.
And we worship Vohu Manah (the Good Mind), and Asha Vahishta (who
is Righteousness the Best), and Khshathra-vairya, the Kingdom
to be desired, and the good and bountiful Armaiti (true piety
in the believers), and Haurvatat and Ameretat (our Weal and Immortality).

4. Yea, we worship the Creator Ahura Mazda and the Fire, Ahura
Mazda's son, and the good waters which are Mazda-made and holy,
and the resplendent sun of the swift horses, and the moon with
the seed of cattle (in his beams); and we worship the star Tishtrya,
the lustrous and glorious; and we worship the soul of the Kine
of blessed endowment, (5) and its Creator Ahura Mazda; and we
worship Mithra of the wide pastures, and Sraosha (Obedience) the
blessed, and Rashnu the most just, and the good, heroic, bountiful
Fravashis of the saints, and the Blow-of-victory Ahura-given (as
it is). And we worship Raman Hvastra, and the bounteous Wind of
blessed gift, (6) and (its) Creator Ahura Mazda, and the good
Mazdayasnian Religion, and the good Blessedness and Arshtat.
And we worship the heaven and the earth of blessed gift, and the
bounteous Mathra, and the stars without beginning (to their course),
self-disposing as they are.

7. And we worship the glorious works of Righteousness in which
the souls of the dead find satisfaction and delight [(Pazand)
which are the Fravashis of the saints], and we worship (Heaven)
the best world of the saints, shining, all glorious.

8. And we worship the two, the milk-offering and the libation,
the two which cause the waters to flow forth, and the plants to
flourish, the two foes who meet the Dragon demon-made; and who
are set to meet, to defeat, and to put to flight, that cheat,
the Pairika, and to contradict the insulting malice of the Ashemaogha
(the persecuting heretic) and that of the unholy tyrant full of
death.

9. And we worship all waters and all plants, and all good men
and all good women. And we worship all these Yazads, heavenly
and earthly, who are beneficent and holy.

10. And we worship thee (our) dwelling-place who art the (earth,
our) bounteous Armaiti, and Thee, O Ahura Mazda, O holy Lord of
this abode! which is the home of healthy herds and healthy men,
and of those who are both endowed with health and lover(s) of
the ritual right.
(Response of the individual worshipper (?).) Wherefore whichever
of persons, or whatever of bodily influences, is most helpful
and preserving in that abode (thus owned by Mazda) let this meet
me in mine abode, and there may it abide for summer and for winter.
(Or let that one meet me in all my house, in whom are what of
influences are the most mighty power for the body and the person's
life; yea, let that one meet me there, and there abide for summer
and for winter (for my help)!)

 - CHAPTER 17

 + NOTE: TO THE FIRES, WATERS, PLANTS, &C.


1-10. (See <a href="#y6">Y6</a>, which is nearly identical with verses 1-10.)

11. We worship thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son! We worship
the fire Berezi-savangha (of the lofty use), and the fire Vohu-fryana
(the good and friendly), and the fire Urvazishta (the most beneficial
and most helpful), and the fire Vazishta (the most supporting),
and the fire Spenishta (the most bountiful), and Nairya-sangha
the Yazad of the royal lineage, and that fire which is the house-lord
of all houses and Mazda-made, even the son of Ahura Mazda, the
holy lord of the ritual order, with all the fires.

12. And we worship the good and best waters Mazda-made, holy,
all the waters Mazda-made and holy, and all the plants which Mazda
made, and which are holy.

13. And we worship the Mathra-spenta (the bounteous word-of-reason),
the Zarathushtrian law against the Daevas, and its long descent.

14. And we worship Mount Ushi-darena which is Mazda-made and shining
with its holiness, and all the mountains shining with holiness,
and of abundant glory, and which Mazda made ---.

15. And we worship the good and pious prayer for blessings, (16)
and these waters and (these lands), (17) and all the greatest
chieftains, lords of the ritual order;

18. And I praise, invoke, and glorify the good, heroic, bountiful
Fravashis of the saints, those of the house, the Vis, the Zantuma,
the Dahvyuma, and the Zarathushtrotema, and all the holy Yazads!

 - CHAPTER 18

1. Grant me, Thou who art maker of the Kine, plants and waters,
Immortality, Mazda! Grant, too, Weal, Spirit bounteous.... (See
Y51.7 and Y47).

 - CHAPTER 19

 + NOTE: ZAND OR COMMENTARY ON THE AHUNA-VAIRYA FORMULAS.


(As the Ahu is excellent, so (is) the Ratu (one who rules)
from the righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of
life's actions done for Mazda; and the Kingdom (is) for Ahura
which to the poor shall offer a nurturer.)

1. Zarathushtra asked of Ahura Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, Thou most
bounteous Spirit! maker of the corporeal worlds, the holy One!
which was that word which Thou did'st declare to me, (2) which
was before the sky, and before the water, before the earth, and
before the cattle, before the plants, and before the fire, and
before the holy man, and the Demon-gods (the Daevas), before the
Khrafstra-men, and before all the incarnate world; even before
all the good creatures made by Mazda, and which contain (and are)
the seed of righteousness?

3. Thereupon Ahura Mazda said: It was this piece, the Ahuna-vairya,
O Spitama Zarathushtra! which I pronounced as thine (4) before
the sky, and before the waters, before the land, and before the
cattle and the plants, and before the fire, Ahura Mazda's son,
before the holy man, and before the Daevas, and Khrafstra-men,
and before the entire corporeal world, even before the good creatures
made by Mazda, which contain (and are) the seed of righteousness.

5. It was these part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
which especially belongs to me, and when each is intoned aloud
without the (needless) repetition of verses and of words, and
without their omission, it is worth a hundred of their other stanzas,
even although they are prominent in the ritual, and likewise equally
as well recited without additions or omissions; nay, further,
when it is intoned imperfectly but added to, and with omissions,
it is even then in effect equivalent (not to a hundred indeed,
but) to ten other (stanzas) that are prominent.

6. And whoever in this world of mine which is corporeal shall
mentally recall, O Spitama* Zarathushtra! a portion of the Ahuna-vairya,
and having thus recalled it, shall undertone it, or beginning
to recite it with the undertone, shall then utter it aloud, or
chanting it with intoning voice, shall worship thus, then with
even threefold (safety and with speed) I will bring his soul over
the Bridge of Chinvat, I who am Ahura Mazda (I will help him to
pass over it) to Heaven (the best life), and to Righteousness
the Best, and to the lights of heaven.

7. And whoever, O Spitama Zarathushtra! while undertoning the
part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya (or this piece the Ahuna-vairya),
takes ought therefrom, whether the half, or the third, or the
fourth, or the fifth, I who am Ahura Mazda will draw his soul
off from the better world; yea, so far off will I withdraw it
as the earth is large and wide; [and this earth is as long as
it is broad].

8. And I pronounced this saying which contains its Ahu and its
Ratu before the creation of this heaven, before the making of
the waters, and the plants, and the four-footed kine, before the
birth of the holy biped man, before this sun with its body made
for the acquisition of the creation of the Bountiful Immortals.

9. And the more bountiful of the two Spirits (Ahura) declared
to me (Zarathushtra) the entire creation of the pure, that which
exists at present, that which is in the course of emerging into
existence, and that which shall be, with reference to the performance
and realization 'of the actions of a life devoted to Mazda.'

10. And this word is the most emphatic of the words which have
ever been pronounced, or which are now spoken, or which shall
be spoken in future; for (the eminence of) this utterance is a
thing of such a nature, that if all the corporeal and living world
should learn it, and learning should hold fast by it, they would
be redeemed from their mortality!

11. And this our word I have proclaimed as a symbol to be learned,
and to be recited, as it were, to every one of the beings under
the influence of and for the sake of Righteousness the Best.

12. And 'as' (the worshipper has) here spoken it forth, when he
has thus 'appointed' the 'Lord and regulator,' so (by thus reciting
these authoritative words), he acknowledges Ahura Mazda (as prior
to, and supreme) over, those creatures who have 'the mind' as
their first. 'As' he acknowledges Him as the greatest of them
all, 'so' he assigns the creatures to Him (as to their originator).

13. As he undertones the third sentence, he thereby announces
that 'all the amenities of life appertain to the 'good' Mazda,
(and come) from Him. As he recites 'dazda manangho,' 'the creator
of mind,' he acknowledges Him as superior and prior to mind; and
as he makes Him the one who indicates (the truth) to mind, (saying)
'manangho of mind,' which means that by this much he makes Him
(its director), and then he makes Him 'the lord of actions.'

14. And when he acknowledges Him for the creatures thus, 'O Mazda!'
he acknowledges Him (as their ruler) when he assigns the creatures
to Him thus. He then assigns the Kingdom to Ahura, saying: 'Thine,
O Mazda! is the Kingdom.' And he assigns a nourisher and protector
to the poor, saying: Yim drigubyo dadat vastarem; that is, as
a friend to Spitama. This is the fifth sentence, (and it concludes)
the entire recital and word, (even) the whole of this word of
Ahura Mazda.

15. He who is the best (of all) Ahura Mazda, pronounced the Ahuna-vairya,
and as He pronounced it as the best, so He caused it to have its
effect, (He, ever) the same, (as He is).
The evil one at once arose (to oppose Him), but He (Ahura) repelled
that wicked one with His interdict, and with this repelling renunciation:
Neither our minds are in harmony, nor our precepts, nor our comprehensions,
nor our beliefs, nor our words, nor our actions, nor our consciences,
nor our souls!

  + NOTE:  <h3>CATECHETICAL ZAND.</h3>


16. And this saying, uttered by Mazda, has three stages, or measures,
and belongs to four classes (of men as its supporters), and to
five chiefs (in the political world, without whom its efficiency
is marred), and it has a conclusion ending with a gift. (Question.)
How are its measures (constituted)? (Answer.) The good thought,
the good word, and the good deed. 17. (Question.) With what classes
of men? (Answer.) The priest, the charioteer (as the chief of
warriors), the systematic tiller of the ground, and the artisan.
These classes therefore accompany the religious man throughout
his entire duty with the correct thought, the truthful word, and
the righteous action. These are the classes and states in life
which give attention to the rulers, and fulfill the (laws) of
religion; (yea, they are the guides and companions of that religious
man) through whose actions the settlements are furthered in righteousness.

18. (Question.) How are the chiefs (constituted)? (Answer.) They
are the house-chief, the village-chief, and the tribe-chief, the
chief of the province, and the Zarathushtra as the fifth. That
is, so far as those provinces are concerned which are different
from, and outside of the Zarathushtrian regency, or domain. [Ragha
which has four chiefs (only) is the Zarathushtrian (district)]
(Question.) How are the chiefs of this one constituted? (Answer.)
They (are) the house-chief, the village-chief, the tribe-chief,
and the Zarathushtra as the fourth. 19. (Question.) What is the
thought well thought? (Answer.) (It is that which the holy man
thinks), the one who holds the holy thought to be before all other
things (Question.) What is the word well spoken? (Answer.) It
is the Mathra Spenta, the bounteous word of reason. (Question.)
What is the deed well done? (Answer.) It is that done with praises,
and by the creatures who regard Righteousness as before all other
things. 20. (Question.) Mazda made a proclamation, whom did He
announce? (Answer.) Some one who was holy, and yet both heavenly
and mundane. (Question.) What was His character, He who made this
sacred enunciation? (Answer.) He who is the best (of all), the
ruling one. (Question.) Of what character (did He proclaim him
the coming one)? (Answer.) As holy and the best, a ruler who exercises
no wanton or despotic power.

21. We sacrifice to the (several) part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya.
We sacrifice to the memorized recital of the Ahuna-vairya, and
its regular chanting and its use in the full Yasna.

 - CHAPTER 20

 + NOTE: ZAND, OR COMMENTARY, ON THE ASHEM VOHU.

1. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the best; there is weal,
there is weal to this man when the Right (helps) the Righteousness
best, (when the pious man serves it in truth). Ahura Mazda spake
forth: Ashem vohu vahishtem asti. To this Asha, the holy ritual
sanctity, one attributes the qualities of 'good' and 'best,' as
one attributes property to an owner; thus this sentence vohu vahishtem
asti is substantiated (at once).

2. Ushta asti ushta ahmai; by this attribution of blessedness
(the praiser) assigns every person (or thing) of a sacred nature
to every holy person, and as one usually (?) and regularly (?)
assigns every person or thing (?) that is holy to every holy man.

3. Hyat ashai vahishtai; by these words the worshipper ascribes
the entire Mathra (to Asha Vahishta), and ascribes all to the
Mathra, as one ascribes the kingdom to Righteousness, and as one
ascribes righteousness to the invoking saint; yea, as one ascribes
righteousness to us who are the prophets (who shall help and bless
the people). The three maxims of the sentences (are thus fulfilled).
And every word (in its detail), and the entire utterance in its
proclamation, is the word of Ahura Mazda.

+ NOTE:<h3>CATECHETICAL ADDITION.</h3>


4. Mazda has made a proclamation. (Question.) Whom did He announce?
(Answer.) That holy one who is both heavenly and earthly. (Question.)
Of what character is He who has thus announced Him? (Answer.)
He is the best, and the one who is exercising sovereign power.
(Question.) Of what character is the man whom He announced? (Answer.)
The holy and the best, the one who rules with no capricious tyranny.

We sacrifice to the (several) part(s) of the Asha Vahishta (prayer).
We sacrifice to the heard-recital of the Asha Vahishta, to its
memorizing, its chanting, and its sacrificial use!


 - CHAPTER 21

 + NOTE: CATECHETICAL ZAND, OR COMMENTARY UPON THE YENHE HATAM.


(The Yenhe. (To that one) of beings do we offer, whose superior
(fidelity) in the sacrifice Ahura Mazda recognizes by reason of
the sanctity (within him; yea, even to those female saints also
do we sacrifice) whose (superior fidelity is thus likewise known;
thus) we sacrifice to (all, to both) the males and females (of
the saints)!)

1. A word for the Yasna by Zarathushtra, the saint, Yenhe, &c.
Here the worshipper indicates and offers the Yasna (which is the
sacrificial worship) of Mazda as by the command (or as the institution)
of Ahura. Hatam. Here the worshipper offers the sacrificial worship
as if with the beings who are among those who are destined to
live. 2. Yaungham. Here he indicates and offers the sacrificial
worship of those holy females who have Aramaiti at their head,
as homage to the Immortals. These are the three sentences which
comprehend all the Yasnian speech. (Question.) To whom is this
Yasna addressed? (Answer.) To the Bountiful Immortals (in the
course of the Yasna). 3. Thereupon spake Mazda: Salvation to this
one, whosoever he may be! May the absolute ruler Ahura grant it.
(Question.) 4. Whom did He answer with this answer? (Answer.)
He answered: The state of salvation; and with this answer, 'the
state of salvation,' he answered every saint who exists, every
one who is coming into existence, and every one who shall exist
in the future. (Question. Who answered thus? Answer.) The best
One. (Question. What did He answer?) (Answer.) The best thing.
(That is,) the best One, Mazda, answered the best and the holy
(answer) for the better and the holy man. 5. We sacrifice to this
piece, the Yenhe hatam, the prominent and holy Yasht.

 - CHAPTER 22

 + NOTE: THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES.

1. With the Baresman brought hither together with the Zaothra,
for the worship of the Creator Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the
glorious, and for that of the Bountiful Immortals, I desire to
approach this Haoma with my praise, offered (as it is) with punctilious
sanctity (or, for a blessing), and this fresh milk, and this plant
Hadhanaepata. 2. And, as an act of worship to the beneficent waters,
I desire to approach these Zaothras with (my) praise offered (as
they are) with punctilious sanctity, having the Haoma with them,
and the flesh, with the Hadhanaepata. And I desire to approach

And I desire to approach these wood-billets and their perfume
with my praise, - thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! Yea,
I desire to approach all good things with my praise, those which
Mazda made, and which have the seed of sanctity (within them),
(4) for the propitiation of Ahura Mazda and of the Bountiful Immortals,
and of Sraosha the blessed, and of Ahura Mazda's Fire, the lofty
ritual lord!

5-19.
(=Y3.5-19; 20-23=Y3.1-4)

20. And I desire to approach this Haoma with (my) praise, that
which is thus lifted up with sanctity, and this milk (fresh as
it is, and as if) living and lifted up with sanctity, and this
plant the Hadhanaepata lifted up with sanctity. 21. And I desire
to approach these Zaothras with (my) praise for the beneficial
waters, these Zaothras which have the Haoma with them and the
milk with them, and the Hadhanaepata, and which are lifted up
with sanctity. And I desire to approach the Haoma-water with (my)
praise for the beneficial waters, and the two mortars, the stone
one and the iron one, (22) and I desire to, approach this branch
for the Baresman with my praise, and the memorized recital and
fulfillment of the Mazdayasnian law, and the heard recital of
the Gathas, and the well-timed and persistent prayer for blessings(uttered)

wide pastures, and of Raman Hvastra, (24) and of the resplendent
sun, immortal, radiant, of the fleet horses, and of Vayu, (of
predominant influence and) working on high, set over the other
beings in the creation [(Pazand); that is for thee thus (O Vayu)
when thine influence is that which appertains to Spenta Mainyu],
and for the propitiation of the most just knowledge Mazda-given,
and of the holy and good Religion, the Mazdayasnian Faith; (25)
for the propitiation of the Mathra Spenta, (the bounteous) and
holy, and the effective, instituted against the Daevas, the Zarathushtrian
law, and of the long descent of the good Mazdayasnian Faith [the
holding in mind and devotion to the Mathra Spenta, and knowledge
of the Mazdayasnian Religion] for the propitiation of the understanding
which is innate and Mazda-made, and of that which is heard by
the ear; (26) and for thy propitiation, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's
son! [(Pazand); (yea) thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son]
with all the fires, and for the propitiation of Mount Ushi-darena,
the Mazda-made, radiant with sanctity; (27) and of all the holy
Yazads, spiritual and earthly, and of the holy Fravashis, the
redoubted and overwhelming, those of the ancient lore, and those
of the next of kin and of the Yazad of the spoken name!

 - CHAPTER 23

 + NOTE: THE FRAVASHIS OF THE SAINTS; PRAYERS FOR THEIR APPROACH.

1. I desire to approach with my praise those Fravashis which
have existed from of old, the Fravashis of the houses, and of
the villages, of the communities, and of the provinces, which
hold the heaven in its place apart, and the water, land, and cattle,
which hold the children in the wombs safely enclosed apart so
that they do not miscarry.

and with my praise, and for those of the Bountiful Immortals,
with all the holy Fravashis which are those of the heavenly Yazads.
And I desire to approach the Fravashi of Gaya Maretan

with all the holy Fravashis of the other ancient counselors as
well. 3. And I desire in my worship to approach toward every holy
Fravashi whosesoever it may be, and wheresoever dead upon this
earth (its possessor may have lain), the pious woman, or the girl
of tender years, the maiden diligent (among the cattle) in the
field (who) may have dwelt (here; yea, all) which are now worshipped
from this house, which are attentive to, and which attain to (our)
good Yasnas and (our) homage. 4. Yea, I desire to approach the
Fravashis of the saints with my praise redoubted (as they are)

and I desire therewith to approach toward all the lords of the
ritual, and with praise; and I desire to approach all the good

for sacrifice and homage, because of Righteousness the Best!

 - CHAPTER 26

 + NOTE: THE FRAVASHIS; SACRIFICE AND PRAISE TO THEM.

1. I praise, invoke, and weave my hymn to the good, heroic, and
bountiful Fravashis of the saints; (and having invoked these,
then) we worship the Nmanyas, and the Visyas, and the Zantumas,
and the Dahvyumas, and the Zarathushtrotemas.

2. And of all these prior Fravashis, we worship here the Fravashi
of Ahura Mazda, which is the greatest and the best, the most beautiful
and the firmest, the most wise and the best in form, and the one
that attains the most its ends because of Righteousness. 3. And
(having invoked them) hither, we worship the good, heroic, bountiful
Fravashis of the holy ones, those of the Bountiful Immortals,
the brilliant, of effective glance, the lofty, the devoted, the
swift ones of the creatures of Ahura who are imperishable and
holy.

4. And (having invoked them) hither, we worship the spirit and
conscience, the intelligence and soul and Fravashi of those holy
men and women who early heard the lore and commands (of God),
and loved and strove after Righteousness, the ritual truth; and
we worship the soul of the Kine of blessed gift. 5. And (having
invoked it) hither, we worship the Fravashi of Gaya Maretan [Gayomard] the
holy, and the sanctity and Fravashi of Zarathushtra Spitama the

 - CHAPTER 27

 + NOTE: PRELUDE TO THE CHIEF RECITAL OF THE AHUNA-VAIRYA.

1. This is to render Him who is of all the greatest, our lord
and master (even) Ahura Mazda. And this to smite the wicked Angra
Mainyu, and to smite Aeshma of the bloody spear, and the Mazainya
Daevas, and to smite all the wicked Varenya Daevas.

2. And this is to further Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious,
to further the Bountiful Immortals, and the influences of the
star Tishtrya, the resplendent, the glorious, (and) to the furtherance
of the holy man, and of all the (bountiful and) holy creatures
of the Bounteous Spirit.

3-5.
(The Ahunwar appears here with Y34.5, the Airyema Ishyo, and
the Ashem Vohu.)

6. The Haomas are crushed, O Mazda, Khshathra, and Asha, O ye
Lords! Good is Sraosha who accompanies the sacrifice with the
great glory, and may he be present affording strenuous help.

7. We are offering saving acts of wisdom and of worship with
the sacred gift of the Ahuna-Vairya intoned with sanctity, and
of the two mortars here brought forward with holy act, and with
that of the correctly uttered words likewise; and therefore may
they be to us the more saving in their wise significance.

8-12.
(See Y33.11-14; and Y1.23, and Y12.)

13. As the Ahu is excellent, so is the Ratu (one who rules) from
(his) sanctity, a creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions
done for Mazda; and the Kingdom (is) for Ahura, which to the poor
may offer a nurturer. 14. (What is Your Kingdom, Your riches;
how may I be Your own in my actions, to nourish Your poor, O Mazda?
Beyond; yea, beyond all we declare You, far from Daevas and Khrafstra-accursed
mortals!)

15. We worship the Ahuna-vairya. We worship Asha Vahishta, the
most beautiful, the Bountiful Immortal.

 - CHAPTER 28

1. With outspread hands in petition for that help, O Mazda, I
will pray for the works of the holy spirit, O thou the Right,
whereby I may please the will of Good Thought and the Ox-Soul.

2. I who would serve you, O Mazda Ahura and Vohu Mano, do ye
give through Asha the blessings of both worlds, the bodily and
that of the Spirit, which set the faithful in felicity.

3. I who would praise ye as never before, Right and Good Thought
and Mazda Ahura, and those for whom Piety makes an imperishable
Dominion to grow; come ye to me help at my call.

4. I who have set my heart on watching over the soul, in union
with Good Thought, and as knowing the rewards of Mazda Ahura for
our works, will, while I have power and strength, teach men to
seek after Right.

5. O Asha, shall I see thee and Good Thought, as one that knows?
(Shall I see) the throne of the mightiest Ahura and the following
of Mazda? Through this word (of promise) on our tongue will we
turn the robber horde unto the Greatest.

6. Come thou with Good Thought, give through Asha, O Mazda, as
the gift to Zarathushtra, according to thy sure words, long enduring
mighty help, and to us, O Ahura, whereby we may overcome the enmity
of our foes.

7. Grant, O thou Asha, the reward, the blessing of Good Thought;
O Piety, give our desire to Vishtaspa and to me; O thou Mazda
and King, grant that your Prophet may command a hearing.

8. The best I ask of Thee, O Best, Ahura (Lord) of one will with
the Best Asha, desiring (it) for the hero Frashaostra and for
those (others) to whom thou wilt give (it), (the best gift) of
Good Mind through all time.

9. With these bounties, O Ahura, may we never provoke your wrath,
O Mazda and Right and Best Thought, we who have been eager in
bringing you songs of praise. Ye are they that are the mightiest
to advance desire and the Dominion of Blessings.

10. The wise whom thou knowest as worthy, for their right (doing)
and their good thought, for them do thou fulfill their longing
for attainment. For I know words of prayer are effective with
Ye, which tend to a good object.

11. I would thereby preserve Right and Good Thought for evermore,
that I may instruct, do thou teach me, O Mazda Ahura, from thy
spirit by thy mouth how it will be with the First Life.

 - CHAPTER 29

1. Unto you wailed the Ox-soul, "For whom did ye fashion
me? Who created me? Violence and rapine (and) savagery hath oppressed
me, and outrage and might. I have no other herdsman than you;
prepare for me then the blessings of pasture."

2. Then the Ox-Creator asked of the Right: "Hast thou a
judge for the Ox, that ye may be able to appoint him zealous tendance
as well as fodder? Whom do ye will to be his lord, who may drive
off violence together with the followers of the Lie?"

3. To him the Right replied: "There is for the Ox no helper
that can keep him away. Those yonder have no knowledge how right-doers
act towards the lowly".
(The Ox-Creator): "Strongest of beings is he to whose help
I come at call".

4. (Asha) "Mazda knoweth best the purposes that have been
wrought already by demons and by mortals, and that shall be wrought
hereafter. He, Ahura, is the decider. So shall it be as he shall
will."

5. (The Ox-Creator) "To Ahura with outspread hands we twain
would pray, my soul and that of the pregnant cow, so that we twain
urge Mazda with entreaties. Destruction is not for the right-living,
nor for the cattle-tender at the hands of Liars."

6. Then spake Ahura Mazda himself, who knows the law with wisdom:
"There is found no lord or judge according to the Right Order
for the Creator hath formed thee for the cattle-tender and the
farmer."

7. This ordinance about the fat hath Ahura Mazda, one in will
with Right, created for cattle, and the milk for them that crave
nourishment, by his command, the holy one.
(The Ox and Cow:) "Whom hast thou, O Good Thought, among
men, who may care for us twain?"

8. (Vohu Manah:) He is known to me here who alone hath heard
our commands, even Zarathushtra Spitama; he willeth to make known
our thoughts, O Mazda, and those of the Right. So let us bestow
on him charm of speech.

9. Then the Ox-Soul lamented: "That I must be content with
the ineffectual word of an impotent man for my protector, when
I wish for one that commands mightily! When ever shall there be
one who shall give him (the Ox) effective help?"

10. (Zarathushtra:) Do ye, O Ahura, grant them strength, and O
Asha, and O Good Thought, that dominion, whereby he (the Savior)
could produce good dwellings and peace. I also have realized thee,
Mazda, as the first to accomplish this.

11. "Where are Right and Good Thought and Dominion? So, ye
men, acknowledge me, for instruction, Mazda, for the great society."

(The Ox and Cow:) "O Ahura, now is help ours, we will be
ready to serve those that are of you."

 - CHAPTER 30

1. Now I will proclaim to those who will hear the things that
the understanding man should remember, for hymns unto Ahura and
prayers to Good Thought; also the felicity that is with the heavenly
lights, which through Right shall be beheld by him who wisely
thinks.

2. Hear with your ears the best things; look upon them with clear-seeing
thought, for decision between the two Beliefs, each man for himself
before the Great consummation, bethinking you that it be accomplished
to our pleasure.

3. Now the two primal Spirits, who reveal themselves in vision
as Twins, are the Better and the Bad, in thought and word and
action. And between these two the wise ones chose aright, the
foolish not so.

4. And when these twain Spirits came together in the beginning,
they created Life and Not-Life, and that at the last Worst Existence
shall be to the followers of the Lie, but the Best Existence to
him that follows Right.

5. Of these twain Spirits he that followed the Lie chose doing
the worst things; the holiest Spirit chose Right, he that clothes
him with the massy heavens as a garment. So likewise they that
are fain to please Ahura Mazda by dutiful actions.

6. Between these twain the Daevas also chose not aright, for
infatuation came upon them as they took counsel together, so that
they chose the Worst Thought. Then they rushed together to Violence,
that they might enfeeble the world of men.

7. And to him (i.e. mankind) came Dominion, and Good Mind, and
Right and Piety gave continued life to their bodies and indestructibility,
so that by thy retributions through (molten) metal he may gain
the prize over the others.

8. So when there cometh their punishment for their sins, then,
O Mazda, at Thy command shall Good Thought establish the Dominion
in the Consummation, for those who deliver the Lie, O Ahura, into
the hands of Right.

9. So may we be those that make this world advance, O Mazda and
ye other Ahuras, come hither, vouchsafing (to us) admission into
your company and Asha, in order that (our) thought may gather
together while reason is still shaky.

10. Then truly on the (world of) Lie shall come the destruction
of delight; but they who get themselves good name shall be partakers
in the promised reward in the fair abode of Good Thought, of Mazda,
and of Right.

11. If, O ye mortals, ye mark those commandments which Mazda hath
ordained — of happiness and pain, the long punishment for the
follower of the Druj, and blessings for the followers of the Right
-- then hereafter shall it be well.

 - CHAPTER 31

1. Mindful of your commands, we proclaim words unpleasant for
them to hear that after the commands of the Lie destroy the creatures
of Right, but most welcome to those that give their heart to Mazda.

2. If by reason of these things the better path is not in sight
for choosing, then will I come to you all as judge of the parties
twain whom Ahura Mazda knoweth, that we may live according to
the Right.

3. What award Thou givest through the (holy) Spirit and through
the Fire and hast taught through Asha, to both the parties, and
what the decision is for the wise, this do Thou tell us, Mazda,
that we may know, even with the tongue of Thine own mouth, that
I may convert all living men.

4. If Asha is to be invoked and Mazda and the other Ahuras and
Ashi and Armaiti, do thou seek for me, O Vohu Manah,<sup>1</sup> the mighty
Dominion, by the increase of which we might vanquish the Lie.

   + NOTE: 1. Boyce: "seek by the best purpose (vahishta manah)..."
  This is an excellent example of the continuous juxtaposition in the Gathas
  of the Amesha Spentas as divinities and things.]


5. Tell me therefore what ye, O thou Right, have appointed me
as the better portion, for me to determine, to know and to keep
in mind, O thou Good Thought — which portion they envy me. Tell
me of all these things. O Mazda Ahura, that shall not or shall
be.

6. To him shall the best befall, who, as one that knows, speaks
to me Right's truthful word of Welfare and of Immortality; even
the Dominion of Mazda which Good Thought shall increase for him.

7. About which he in the beginning thus thought, "let the
blessed realms be filled with Light", he it is that by his
wisdom created Right. (Those realms) that the Best Thought shall
possess those dost Thou exalt, O Mazda, through the Spirit, which,
O Ahura, is ever the same.

8. I recognize Thee, O Mazda, in my thought, that Thou the First
art (also) the Last — that Thou art Father of Vohu Manah; --
when I apprehend Thee with mine eye, that Thou art the true Creator
of Right [Asha], and art the Lord to judge the actions of life.

9. Thine was Armaiti, Thine the Ox-Creator, (namely) the Wisdom
of the Spirit, O Mazda Ahura, because Thou didst give (the cattle)
choice whether to depend on a husbandman or one who is no husbandman.

10. So she chose for herself out of the two the cattle-tending
husbandman as her lord to guard the Right, the man that advances
Good Thought. He that is no-husbandman, O Mazda, however eager
he be, has no part in this good message.

11. When Thou, O Mazda, in the beginning didst create the Individual
and the Individuality, through Thy Spirit, and powers of understanding
- when Thou didst make life clothed with the body, when (Thou
madest) actions and teachings, whereby one may exercise one's
convictions at one's free-will;

12. Then lifts up his voice the false speaker or the true speaker,
he that knows or he that knows not, (each) according to his own
heart and mind. Passing from one to another Armaiti confers with
the spirit in whom there is wavering.

13. Whatever open or whatever secret (acts) may be visited with
punishment, or whether a person for a little sin demands the highest
punishment, — of all this through Asha Thou art aware, observing
it with Thy flashing eye.

14. These things I ask Thee, O Ahura, how will these come and
happen — the dues, that in accord with the records are appointed
for the righteous, and those, O Mazda, for the followers of the
Druj, — how shall these be when they come to the reckoning.

15. This I ask, what penalty is for him who seeks to achieve kingdom
for a liar, for a man of ill deeds, O Ahura, who finds not his
living without injury to the husbandman's cattle and men, though
he does him no injury.

16. This I ask, whether the understanding man, who strives to
advance the Dominion over the house, or district, or land through
Asha, shall become like Thee, O Mazda Ahura, when will he be and
how will he act?

17. Which is the greater — what the follower of Asha or what
the follower of Druj believe? Let him that knows inform the wise;
no longer let him that knows nothing deceive. Be to us, O Mazda
Ahura, the Teacher of Good Thought.

18. Let none of you listen to the words and commands of the follower
of the Druj; for he brings house and clan and district and land
into misery and destruction. Resist them with weapon!

19. To him should we listen who has understood Asha, to the wise
Healer of Life O Ahura, who can or will establish the truth of
the words of his tongue, when through Thy red Fire, O Mazda, the
assignment (of rewards) is made to the two parties.

20. Whosoever cometh over to the Righteous, far from him hereafter
shall be long age of misery (and) darkness, ill-food, and crying
of woe. To such an existence, ye followers of the Lie, shall your
own Self bring you through your (own) action.

21. Mazda Ahura by virtue of His absolute Lordship will grant
a perpetuity of communion with Haurvatat and Ameretat, and with
Asha, with Khshathra, and with Vohu Manah, to him that in spirit
and in action is his friend.

22. Clear it is to the man of understanding, as one who has realized
it with his thought. He upholds Asha together with good Dominion
by his word and deed. He will be, O Mazda Ahura, the most helpful
helper to Thee.

 - CHAPTER 32

1. (Zarathushtra) — And his blessedness, even that of Ahura
Mazda, shall the nobles strive to attain, his the community with
the brotherhood, his, ye Daevas, in the manner as I declare it.

(The Representatives of the Classes) — As thy messengers we would
keep them far away that are enemies to you.

2. To them Mazda Ahura, who is united with Good Thought, and
is in goodly fellowship with glorious Right, through Dominion,
made reply: We make choice of your holy good Piety [Armaiti] — may it be
ours.

3. (Zarathushtra) — But ye, ye Daevas all, and he that highly
honors you, are the seed of Bad Thought — yes, and of the Lie
and of Arrogance, likewise your deeds, whereby ye have long been
known in the seventh region of the earth.

4. For ye have brought it to pass that men who do the worst things
shall be called beloved of the Daevas, separating themselves from
Good Thought, departing from the will of Mazda Ahura and from
Right.

5. Thereby ye defrauded mankind of happy life and immortality,
by the deed which he and the Bad Spirit together with Bad Thought
and Bad Word taught you, ye Daevas and the Liars, so as to ruin
(mankind).

6. The many sins by which he has succeeded in being famous whether
by these it shall be thus, this Thou Knowest by the Best Thought,
O Ahura, Thou who art mindful of each person's deserts. In Thy
Dominion, O Mazda, and that of Asha, shall your decision thereon
be observed.

7. None of these sins will the understanding commit, in eagerness
to attain the blessing that shall be proclaimed, we know, through
the glowing metal — sins the issue of which, O Ahura Mazda, Thou
knowest best.

8. Among these sinners, we know, Yima was included, Vivanghen's
son, who desiring to satisfy men gave our people flesh of the
ox to eat. From these shall I be separated by Thee, O Mazda, at
last.

9. The teacher of evil destroys the lore, he by his teaching
destroys the design of life, he prevents the possession of Good
Thought from being prized. These words of my spirit I wail unto
you, O Mazda, and to the Right.

10. He it is that destroys, who declares that the Ox and the Sun
are the worst things to behold with the eyes, and hath made the
pious into liars, and desolates the pastures and lifts his weapon
against the righteous man.

11. It is they, the liars, who destroy life, who are mightily
determined to deprive matron and master of the enjoyment of their
heritage, in that they would prevent the righteous, O Mazda, from
the Best Thought.

12. Since they by their lore would pervert men from the best doing,
Mazda uttered evil against them, who destroy the life of the Ox
with shouts of joy, by whom Grehma and his tribe are preferred
to the Right and the Karapan and the lordship of them that seek
after the Lie.

13. Since Grehma shall attain the realm in the dwelling of the
Worst Thought, he and the destroyers of life, O Mazda, they shall
lament in their longing for the message of Thy prophet, who will
stay them from beholding the Right.

14. To his undoing Grehma, and the Kavis, have long devoted their
purpose and energies, for they set themselves to help the liar,
and that it may be said, "The Ox shall be slain that it may
kindle the Averter of Death to help us."

15. Thereby hath come to ruin the Karapan and the Kavi community,
through those whom they will not have to rule over their life.
These shall be born away from them both to the dwelling of Good
Thought.

16. ..., who hast power, O Mazda Ahura, on him who threatens to
be my undoing, that I may fetter the men of the Lie in their violence
against my friends.

 - CHAPTER 33

1. According as it is with the laws that belong to the present
life, so shall the Judge act with most just deed towards the man
of the Lie and the man of the Right, and him whose false things
and good things balance (in equal measure).

2. Whoso worketh ill for the liar by word or thought or hands,
or converts his dependent to the good — such men meet the will
of Ahura Mazda to his satisfaction.

3. Whose is most good to the righteous man, be he noble or member
of the community or the brotherhood, Ahura — or with diligence
cares for the cattle, he shall be hereafter in the pasture of
Right and Good Thought [Asha and Vohu Manah].

4. I who by worship would keep far from Thee, O Mazda, disobedience
and Bad Thought, heresy from the nobles, and from the community
the Lie, that is most near, and from the brotherhood the slanderers,
and the worst herdsmen from the pastures of the cattle; --

5. I who would invoke thy Obedience as the greatest of all at
the Consummation, attaining long life, and the Dominion of Good
Thought, and the straight ways into Right, wherein Mazda Ahura
dwells.

6. I, as a priest, who would learn the straight (paths) by the
Right, would learn by the Best Spirit how to practice husbandry
by that thought in which it is thought of; these Twain of Thine,
O Ahura Mazda, I strive to see and take counsel with them.

7. Come hither to me, O ye Best Ones, hither, O Mazda, in Thine
own person and visibly, O Right and Good Thought, that I may be
heard beyond the limits of the people. Let the august duties be
manifest among us and clearly viewed.

8. Consider ye my matters whereon I am active, O Good Thought,
my worship, O Mazda, towards one like you, and O Right, the words
of my praise. Grant, O Welfare and Immortality, your own everlasting
blessing.

9. That Spirit of Thine, Mazda, together with the comfort of
the Comrades Twain, who advance the Right, let the Best Thought
bring through the Reform wrought by me. Sure is the support of
those twain, whose souls are one.

10. All the pleasures of life which thou holdest, those that were,
that are, and that shall be O Mazda, according to thy good will
apportion them. Through Good Thought advance thou the body, through
Dominion and Right at will.

11. The most mighty Ahura Mazda, and Piety, and Right that blesses
our substance, and Good Thought and Dominion, hearken unto me,
be merciful to me, when to each man the recompense comes.

12. Rise up for me, O Ahura, through Armaiti give strength, through
the holiest Spirit give might, O Mazda, through the good Recompense
[<i>âdâ</i>, offering],
through the Right give powerful prowess, through Good Thought
give the reward.

13. To support me, O Thou that seest far onward, do ye assure
me the incomparable things in your Dominion, O Ahura, as the Destiny
of Good Thought. O Holy Armaiti, teach the Daenas about the Right.

14. As an offering Zarathushtra brings the life of his own body,
the choiceness of good thought, action, and speech, unto Mazda,
unto the Right, Obedience, and Dominion.

 - CHAPTER 34

1. The action, the word, and the worship for which Thou, O Mazda,
shalt bestow Immortality and Right, and Dominion of Welfare -
through multitudes of these, O Ahura, we would that thou shouldst
give them.

2. And all the actions of the good spirit [Spenta Mainyu -JHP] and the holy man, whose
soul follows the Right, do ye set with the thought (thereof) in
thine outer court, O Mazda, when ye are adored with hymns of praise.

3. To Thee and to Right [Asha] we will offer the sacrifice [myazda,
i.e. offering] with due service [veneration], that in (Thy established)
Dominion ye may bring all creatures to perfection through Good Thought.
For the reward of the wise man is for ever secure, O Mazda, among you.

4. Of Thy Fire, O Ahura, that is mighty through Right, promised
and powerful, we desire that it may be for the faithful man with
manifested delight, but for the enemy with visible torment, according
to the pointings of the hand.

5. Have ye Dominion and power, O Mazda, Right and Good Thought,
to do as I urge upon you, even to protect your poor man? We have
renounced the robber-gangs, both demons and men.

6. If ye are truly thus, O Mazda, Right and Good Thought, then
give me this token, even a total reversal of this life, that I
may come before you again more joyfully with worship and praise.

7. Can they be true to thee, O Mazda, who by their doctrines
turn the known inheritances of Good Thought into misery and woe
[usheuru?]. I know none other but you, O Right, so do ye protect
us.

8. For by these actions they put us in fear, in which peril is
for many — in that the stronger (puts in fear) (me) the weaker
one — through hatred of thy commandment, O Mazda. They that will
not have the Right in their thought, from them shall the Good
Abode be far.

9. These men of evil action who spurn the holy Piety, precious
to thy wise one, O Mazda, through their having no part in Good
Thought, from them Right shrinks back far, as from us shrink the
wild beasts of prey.

10. The man of understanding [or good will] has instructed (people) to cling
to action of this Good Thought [Vohu Manah], and to the Holy Piety
[Spenta Armaiti], creator, comrade of Right [Asha] — wise that he is,
and to all hope, O Ahura,
that are in thy Dominion, O Mazda.

11. And both thy (gifts) shall be for sustenance, even nectar
and ambrosia. Piety linked with Right shall advance the Dominion
of Good Thought, its permanence and power. By these, O Mazda,
dost thou bless the foes of thy foes.

12. What is thine ordinance? What willst thou? What of praise
or what of worship? Proclaim it, Mazda, that we may hear what
ordinances Destiny will apportion. Teach us by Right the paths
of Good Thought that are blessed to go in, -

13. Even that way of Good Thought, O Ahura, of which thou didst
speak to me, whereon, a way well made by Right, the Daena of the
future benefactors shall pass to the reward that was prepared
for the wise, of which thou art determinant, O Mazda.

14. The precious reward, then, O Mazda, ye will give by the action
of Good Thought to the bodily life of those who are in the community
that tends the pregnant cow, (the promise of) your good doctrine,
Ahura, that of the wisdom which exalts communities through Right.

15. O Mazda, make known to me the best teachings and actions, these
O Good Thought and O Right the due of praise. Through your Dominion,
O Ahura, assure us that mankind shall be capable according to
(Thy) will.

<h2>YASNA HAPTANGHAITI.</h2>

 - CHAPTER 35


  + NOTE: (Translated by L. H. Mills, from <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>,
  American Edition, 1898.)


<h4>PRAISE TO AHURA AND THE IMMORTALS; PRAYER FOR THE PRACTICE
AND DIFFUSION OF THE FAITH.</h4>

1. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy Lord of the ritual order,
and to the Bountiful Immortals, who rule aright, who dispose of
all aright; and we sacrifice to the entire creation of the clean,
the spiritual and the mundane, with the longing blessing of the
beneficent ritual, with the longing blessing of the benignant
Religion, the Mazdayasnian Faith.

2. We are praisers of good thoughts, of good words, and of good
actions, of those now and those hereafter [(Pazand) of those being
done; and of those completed]. We implant (?) them (with our homage,
and we do this) the more, and yet the more since we are (praisers)
of the good (from whom they spring).

3. That, therefore, would we choose, O Ahura Mazda! and thou,
O Righteousness the beauteous! that we should think, and speak,
and do those thoughts, and words, and deeds, among actual good
thoughts, and words, and actions, which are the best for both
the worlds; (4) and together with these gifts (?) and actions
which are thus the best, we would pray for the Kine (which represents
the pure creation), that she may have comfort and have fodder
from the famed! and from the humble, from the potent and the weak.

5. To the best of good rulers (is) verily the Kingdom, because
we render and ascribe it to Him, and make it thoroughly His own
(?), to Mazda Ahura do we ascribe it, and to Righteousness the
Best.

6. As thus both man or woman knows (the duty), both thoroughly
and truly, so let him, or her, declare it and fulfill it, and
inculcate it upon those who may perform it as it is. 7. We would
be deeply mindful of Your sacrifice and homage, Yours, O Ahura
Mazda! and the best, (and we would be mindful) of the nurture
of the Kine. And that let us inculcate, and perform for You according
as we may; and (for) such (praisers as we are).

8. Under the shelter of the ritual Order let us do so in the
active fulfillment of its (precepts) toward every one of the (clean)
and better creatures which are fit to live, with a gift for both
the worlds.

9. Yea, those words and sayings, O Ahura Mazda! we would proclaim
as Righteousness, and as of the better mind (?); and we would
make Thee the one who both supports (us in our proclamation) of
them, and who throws still further light upon them (as they are),

10. And by reason of Thy Righteous Order, Thy Good Mind, and Thy
Sovereign Power, and through the instrumentality of our praises
of Thee, O Ahura Mazda! and for the purpose of (still further)
praises, by Thy spoken words, and for (still further) spoken words,
through Thy Yasna, and for (still further) Yasnas (would we thus
proclaim them, and make Thee the bestower of our light).

 - CHAPTER 36

<h4>TO AHURA AND THE FIRE.</h4>

1. We would approach You two, O (Ye) primeval ones in the house
of this Thy holy Fire, O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit!
Who brings pollutions to this (Thy flame) him wilt Thou cover
with pollutions (in his turn). 2. But as the most friendly do
Thou give us zeal, O Fire of the Lord! and approach us, and with
the loving blessing of the most friendly, with the praise of the
most adored. Yea, may'st thou approach to aid us in this our greatest
(undertaking) among the efforts of our zeal.

3. The Fire of Ahura Mazda art thou verily; yea, the most bounteous
one of His Spirit, wherefore Thine is the most potent of all names
(for grace), O Fire of the Lord! 4. And therefore we would approach
Thee, (O Ahura!) with the help of Thy Good Mind (which Thou dost
implant within us), with Thy (good) Righteousness, and with the
actions and the words inculcated by Thy good wisdom!

5. We therefore bow before Thee, and we direct our prayers to
Thee with confessions of our guilt, O Ahura Mazda! with all the
good thoughts (which Thou dost inspire), with all the words well
said, and the deeds well done, with these would we approach Thee.
6. And to Thy most beauteous body do we make our deep acknowledgments,
O Ahura Mazda! to those stars (which are Thy body); and to that
one, the highest of the high, [such as the sun was called]!

 - CHAPTER 37

<h4>TO AHURA, THE HOLY CREATION, THE FRAVASHIS OF THE JUST, AND
THE BOUNTIFUL IMMORTALS.</h4>

1. Thus therefore do we worship Ahura Mazda, who made the Kine
(the living creation), and the (embodied) Righteousness (which
is incarnate in the clean), and the waters, and the wholesome
plants, the stars, and the earth, and all (existing) objects that
are good. 2. Yea, we worship Him for His Sovereign Power and His
greatness, beneficent (as they are), and with priority among the
Yazads who abide beside the Kine (and care for her protection
and support).

3. And we worship Him under His name as Lord, to Mazda dear,
the most beneficent (of names). We worship him with our bones,
and with our flesh, (with our bodies and our life). And we worship
the Fravashis of the saints, of holy men, and holy women; (4)
and Righteousness the Best do we worship, the most beauteous,
the Bountiful Immortal and that which is endowed with light in
all things good.

5. And we worship the Good Mind (of the Lord), and His Sovereign
Power, and the Good Faith, the good law of our thrift, and Piety
the ready mind (within Thy folk)!

 - CHAPTER 38

<h4>TO THE EARTH AND THE SACRED WATERS.</h4>

1. And now we worship this earth which bears us, together with
Thy wives, O Ahura Mazda! yea, those Thy wives do we worship which
are so desired from their sanctity. 2. We sacrifice to their zealous
wishes, and their capabilities, their inquiries (as to duty),
and their wise acts of pious reverence, and with these their blessedness,
their full vigor and good portions, their good fame and ample
wealth. 3. O ye waters! now we worship you, you that are showered
down, and you that stand in pools and vats, and you that bear
forth. (our loaded vessels?) ye female Ahuras of Ahura, you that
serve us (all) in helpful ways, well forded and full-flowing,
and effective for the bathings, we will seek you and for both
the worlds! 4. Therefore did Ahura Mazda give you names, O ye
beneficent ones! when He who made the good bestowed you. And by
these names we worship you, and by them we would ingratiate ourselves
with you, and with them would we bow before you, and direct our
prayers to you with free confessions of our debt. O waters, ye
who are productive, and ye maternal ones, ye with heat that suckles
the (frail and) needy (before birth), ye waters (that have once
been) rulers of (us) all, we will now address you as the best,
and the most beautiful; those (are) yours, those good (objects)
of our offerings, ye long of arm to reach our sickness, or misfortune,
ye mothers of our life!

 - CHAPTER 39

<h4>TO THE SOUL OF THE KINE, &C.</h4>

1. And now we sacrifice to the Kine's soul, and to her created
body, and we sacrifice to the souls of cattle who are fit to live
(for us), and whose (we?) are, such as are the same to them.

2. And we worship the souls of those beasts which are tame and
broken in, and of wild herds, and the souls of the saints wherever
they were born, both of men and of women, whose good consciences
are conquering in the strife against the Daevas, or will conquer,
or have conquered.

3. And now we worship the Bountiful Immortals (all) the good,
and both those male, and those female (by their names). The males
among them do we worship, ever living, and ever helpful, who dwell
beside the pious, and the females thus the same. 4. As Thou, O
Ahura Mazda! hast thought and spoken, as thou hast determined,
and hast done these things (effecting) what is good, therefore
do we offer to Thee, therefore do we ascribe to Thee our praises,
and worship Thee, and bow ourselves before Thee; and therefore
would we direct our prayers to Thee, Ahura! with confessions of
our sin.

5. And we thus draw near to Thee together with the good kinship
of our kindred, with that of Righteousness the blessed, and the
good law of thrift and energy and the good Piety, the ready mind
(within Thy folk)!

 - CHAPTER 40

<h4>PRAYERS FOR HELPERS.</h4>

1. And now in these Thy dispensations, O Ahura Mazda! do Thou
wisely act for us, and with abundance with Thy bounty and Thy
tenderness as touching us; and grant that reward which Thou hast
appointed to our souls, O Ahura Mazda! 2. Of this do Thou Thyself
bestow upon us for this world and the spiritual; and now as part
thereof (do Thou grant) that we may attain to fellowship with
Thee, and Thy Righteousness for all duration.

3. And do Thou grant us, O Ahura! men who are righteous, and
both lovers and producers of the Right as well. And give us trained
beasts for the pastures, broken in for riding, and for bearing,
(that they may be) in helpful companionship with us, and as a
source of long enduring vigor, and a means of rejoicing grace
to us for this.

4. So let there be a kinsman lord for us, with the laborers of
the village, and so likewise let there be the clients (or the
peers). And by the help of those may we arise.
So may we be to You, O Mazda Ahura! holy and true, and with free
giving of our gifts.

 - CHAPTER 41

<h4>A PRAYER TO AHURA AS THE KING, THE LIFE, AND THE REWARDER.</h4>

1. Praises, and songs, and adorations do we offer to Ahura Mazda,
and to Righteousness the Best; yea, we offer and we ascribe them,
and proclaim them. 2. And to Thy good Kingdom, O Ahura Mazda!
may we attain for ever, and a good King be Thou over us; and let
each man of us, and so each woman, thus abide, O Thou most beneficent
of beings, and for both the worlds! 3. Thus do we render Thee.
the helpful Yazad, endowed with good devices, the friend of them
(who worship Thee) with (well-adjusted) ritual; so may'st Thou
be to us our life, and our body's vigor, O Thou most beneficent
of beings, and that for both the worlds!

4. Aye, let us win and conquer (?) long life, O Ahura Mazda!
in Thy grace, and through Thy will may we be powerful. May'st
Thou lay hold on us to help, and long, and with salvation, O Thou
most beneficent of beings!

5. Thy praisers and Mathra-speakers may we be called, O Ahura
Mazda! so do we wish, and to this may we attain. What reward most
meet for our deserving Thou hast appointed for the souls, O Ahura
Mazda! (6) of that do Thou bestow on us for this life, and for
that of mind. Of that reward (do Thou Thyself grant this advantage),
that we may come under Thy protecting guardianship, and that of
Righteousness for ever. We sacrifice to that brave Yasna, the
Yasna Haptanghaiti, the holy, the ritual chief!

 - CHAPTER 42

<h4>A SUPPLEMENT TO THE HAPTANGHAITI.</h4>

1. We worship You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! the entire collection
of this Yasna, Haptanghaiti (as we sum up all). And we sacrifice
to the fountains of the waters, and to the fordings of the rivers,
to the forkings of the highways, and to the meetings of the roads.

2. And we sacrifice to the hills that run with torrents, and
the lakes that brim with waters! and to the corn that fills the
corn-fields; and we sacrifice to both the protector and the Creator,
to both Zarathushtra and the Lord.

3. And we sacrifice to both earth and heaven, and to the stormy
wind that Mazda made, and to the peak of high Haraiti, and to
the land, and all things good.

4. And we worship the Good Mind (in the living) and the spirits
of the saints. And we sacrifice to the fish of fifty-fins, and
to that sacred beast the Unicorn (?) which stands in Vouru-kasha,
and we sacrifice to that sea of Vouru-kasha where he stands, (5)
and to the Haoma, golden-flowered, growing on the heights; yea,
to the Haoma that restores us, and aids this world's advance.
We sacrifice to Haoma that driveth death afar, (6) and to the
flood-streams of the waters, and to the great flights of the birds,
and to the approaches of the Fire-priests, as they approach us
from afar, and seek to gain the provinces, and spread the ritual
lore. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful Immortals all!

 - CHAPTER 43

1. To each several man, to whom Mazda Ahura ruling at his will
grant after the (petitioner's) will, I will after his will that
he attain permanence and power, lay hold of Right - grant this,
O Piety, - the destined gift of wealth, the life of the Good Thought,

2. and it shall be for him the best of all things. After his
longing for bliss may one be given bliss, through the provident
most holy spirit, O Mazda, even the blessings of Good Thought
which thou wilt give through Right all the days with joy of enduring
life.

3. May he attain to that which is better than the good, who would
teach us the straight paths of blessedness in this life here of
the body and in that of thought - true paths that lead to the
world where Ahura Mazda dwells - a faithful man, well-knowing
and holy like thee, O Mazda.

4. Then shall I recognize thee as strong and holy, O Mazda, when
by the hand in which thou thyself dost hold the destinies that
thou wilt assign to the Liar and the Righteous, by the glow of
thy Fire whose power is Right, the might of Good Thought shall
come to me.

5. As the holy one [spenta] I recognize thee, Mazda Ahura, when I saw
thee in the beginning at the birth of Life, when thou madest actions
and words to have their meed — evil for the evil, a good destiny
for the good — through thy wisdom when creation shall reach its
goal.

6. At which goal thou wilt come with thy holy Spirit, O Mazda,
with Dominion, at the same with Good Thought, by whose action
the settlements will prosper through Right. Their judgments shall
Piety proclaim, even those of thy wisdom which none can deceive.

7. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me and asked me: "Who art thou? to whom dost
thou belong? By what signs wilt thou appoint the days for questioning
about thy possessions and thyself?"

8. Then I said to him: "To the first (question), Zarathushtra
am I, a true foe to the Liar, to the utmost of my power, but a
powerful support would I be to the Righteous, that I may attain
the future things of the infinite Dominion, according as I praise
and sing thee, O Mazda.

9. As the holy one I recognize thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good Thought
came to me. To his question, "For which wilt thou decide"
(I made reply). "At the gift of adoration to thy Fire, I
will bethink me of Right so long as I have power.

10. Then show me Right, upon whom I call.
(Mazda:) "Associating him with Piety, I have come hither.
Ask us now what things are here for thee to ask. For thy asking
is as that of a mighty one, since he that is able should make
thee as a mighty one possessed of thy desire."

11. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me, when first by your words I was instructed.
Shall it bring me sorrow among men, my devotion, in doing that
which ye tell me is the best.

12. And when thou saidest to me, 'To Right shalt thou go for teaching',
then thou didst not command what I did not obey: 'Speed thee,
ere my Obedience come, followed by treasure-laden Destiny, who
shall render to men severally the destiny of the two-fold award.'

13. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me to learn the state of my desire. Grant it me,
that which none may compel you to allow, (the wish) for long continuance
of blessed existence that they say is in thy Dominion.

14. If thy provident side, such as an understanding man who has
the power would give to his friends, comes to me by the Dominion
through Right, then I will bestir myself to set myself in opposition
against the foes of thy Law, together with all those who are mindful
of thy words.

15. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me, when the best Tushna-Matay taught me to declare:
"Let not men seek again and again to please the Liars, for
they make all the righteous enemies."

16. And Zarathushtra himself, O Ahura, chooses each one of thy
holiest Spirit, O Mazda. May Right be embodied full of life and
strength! May Piety abide in the Dominion bright as the sun! May
Good Thought give destiny to men according to their works!

 - CHAPTER 44

1. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - as to prayer, how
it should be to one of you. O Mazda Ahura, might one like thee
teach to a friend such as I am, and through friendly Right give
us support, that Good Thought may come to us.

2. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether at the beginning
of the Best Existence the recompenses shall bring blessedness
to him that meets with them. Surely he, O Right, the holy one,
who watches in his spirit the transgression of all, if himself
the benefactor of all that lives, O Mazda.

3. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who is by generation
the Father of Right, at the first? Who determined the path of
sun and stars? Who is it by whom the moon waxes and wanes again?
This, O Mazda, and yet more, I am fain to know.

4. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who upholds the earth
beneath and the firmament from falling? Who the waters and the
plants? Who yoked swiftness to winds and clouds? Who is, O Mazda,
creator of Good Thought?

5. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. What artist made light
and darkness? What artist made sleep and waking? Who made morning,
noon, and night, that call the understanding man to his duty?

6. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether what I proclaim
is verily the truth. Will Right with its actions give aid (at
the last)? will Piety? Will Good Thought announce from the Dominion?
For whom hast thou made the pregnant cow that brings good luck?

7. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who created together
with Dominion the precious Piety? Who made by wisdom the son obedient
to his father? I strive to recognize by these things thee, O Mazda,
creator of all things through the holy spirit.

8. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. I could keep in mind
thy design, O Mazda, and understand aright the maxims of life
which I ask of Good Thought and Right. How will my soul partake
of the good that gives increase?

9. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether for the Self
that I would bring to perfection, that of the man of insight,
the Lord of Dominion would make promises of the sure Dominion,
one of thy likenesses, O Mazda, who dwells in one abode with (Right)
and Good Thought.

10. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. The Religion which
is best for (all) that are, which in union with Right should prosper
all that is mine, will they duly observe it, the religion of my
creed, with words and action of Piety, in desire for thy (future)
good things, O Mazda?

11. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether Piety will
extend to those to whom thy Religion shall be proclaimed? I was
ordained at the first for this by thee; all others I look upon
with hatred of spirit.

12. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who among those with
whom I would speak is a righteous man, and who a liar? On which
side is the enemy? (On this), or is he the enemy, the Liar who
opposes thy blessings? How shall it be with him? Is he not to
be thought of as an enemy?

13. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether we shall drive
the Lie away from us to those who being full of disobedience will
not strive after fellowship with Right, nor trouble themselves
with counsel of Good Thought.

14. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether I would put
the Lie into the hands of Right, to cast her down by the words
of thy lore, to work a mighty destruction among the Liars, to
bring torments upon them and enmities, O Mazda.

15. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - if thou hast power
over this to ward off from me through Right, when the two opposing
hosts meet in battle according to those decrees which thou wilt
firmly establish. Whether is it of the twain that thou wilt give
victory.

16. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who is victorious to
protect by thy doctrine (all) that are? By vision assure me how
to set up the judge that heals the world. Then let him have Obedience
coming with Good Thought unto every man whom thou desirest, O
Mazda.

17. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether through you
I shall attain my goal, O Mazda, even attachment unto you, and
that my voice may be effectual, that Welfare and Immortality may
be ready to unite according to that promise with him who joins
himself with Right.

18. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether I shall indeed,
O Right, earn the reward, even ten mares with a stallion and a
camel, which was promised to me, O Mazda, as well as through thee,
the future gift of Welfare and Immortality.

19. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. He that will not give
the reward to him that earns it, even to the man who fulfilling
his word gives him (what he undertook) - what penalty shall come
to him for the same at the present? I know that which shall come
to him at the last.

20. Have the Daevas ever exercised good dominion? And I ask of
those who see how for the Daevas' sake the Karapan and the Usij
give cattle to violence, and how the Kavi made them continually
to mourn, instead of taking care that they make the pastures prosper
through Right.

 - CHAPTER 45

1. I will speak forth: hear now and hearken now, ye from near
and ye from far that desire (instruction). Now observe this in
your mind, all of you, for he is revealed. Never shall the false
Teacher destroy the Second Life, the Liar, in perversion by his
tongue into evil belief.

2. I will speak of the Spirits twain at the first beginning of
the world, of whom the holier spoke thus to the enemy: "Neither
thought, nor teachings, nor wills, nor beliefs, nor words, nor
deeds, nor selfs, nor souls of us twain agree".

3. I will speak of that which Mazda Ahura, the all-knowing, revealed
to me first in this (earthly) life. Those of you that put not
in practice this word as I think and utter it, to them shall be
woe at the end of life.

4. I will speak of what is best for the life. Through Asha I
have come to know, O Mazda, who created it (the life), the father
of active Good Thought: but his daughter is the good-working Armaiti.
The all-observant Ahura is not to be deceived.

5. I will speak of that which (he), the Holiest declared to me
as the word that is best for mortals to obey; while he said: "they
who for my sake render him obedience, shall all attain unto Welfare
and Immortality by the actions of the Good Spirit [Spenta Mainyu -JHP]" - (he)
Mazda Ahura.

6. I will speak of him who is the greatest of all, praising him,
O Right, who is bounteous to all that live. By the holy spirit
let Mazda Ahura hearken, in whose Adoration I have been instructed
by Good Thought. By his wisdom let him teach me what is best,

7. Even he whose two awards, whereof he ordains, men shall attain,
who so are living or have been or shall be. In immortality shall
the soul of the righteous be joyful, in perpetuity shall be the
torment of Liars. All this doth Mazda Ahura appoint by his Dominion.

8. Him thou shouldst seek to win for us by hymns of adoration
(in thy mind): "Now indeed have I seen it with mine eye,
(the Kingdom) of the good spirit [Spenta Mainyu -JHP] and of (good) action and word,
since I have learnt to know Mazda Ahura through Right". Let
us offer him homage in the House of Song [Heaven].

9. Him thou shouldst seek to propitiate for us together with
Good Thought, who at his will maketh us weal or woe. May Mazda
Ahura by his Dominion bring us to work, for prospering our beasts
and our men, so that we may through Right have familiarity with
Good Thought.

10. Him thou shouldst seek to exalt with prayers of piety, him
that is called Mazda Ahura for ever, for that he hath promised
through his own Right and Good Thought that Welfare and Immortality
shall be for us in his Dominion strength and perpetuity in his
house.

11. Whoso therefore in the future lightly esteemeth the Daeva
and those mortals that lightly esteem him - even all others save
that one who highly esteemeth him, - unto his shall the holy Daena
of the future deliverer, as lord of the house, be friend, brother
or father, O Mazda Ahura.

 - CHAPTER 46

1. To what land shall I go to flee, whither to flee? From nobles
and from my peers they sever me, nor are the people pleased with
me [......], nor the Liar rulers of the land. How am I to please
thee, Mazda Ahura?

2. I know wherefore, O Mazda, I have been unable (to achieve)
anything. Only a few herds are mine (and therefore it is so) and
because I have got but few people. I cry unto thee, see thou to
it, O Ahura, granting me support a friend gives to friend. Teach
me through the Right what the acquisition of Good Thought is.

3. When, Mazda, shall the sunrisings come forth for the worlds
winning of Right, through the powerful teachings of the wisdom
of the future Deliverers? Who are they to whose help Good Thought
shall come? I have faith that thou wilt thyself fulfill this for
me, O Ahura.

4. The Liar stays the supporter of Right from prospering the
cattle in district and province, infamous that he is, repellent
in his actions. Whoso, Mazda, robs him of dominion or of life,
he shall go before and prepare the ways of the good belief.

5. If an understanding man should be able to hold one who comes
over from his vow and his ties of faith, himself having brought
him thereto, and living according to the ordinance, a righteous
man (converting) a Liar - then shall he, when he is sure of him,
tell it to the nobles, that they may protect him from injury,
O Mazda Ahura.

6. But whoso when thus approached should refuse his aid, he shall
go to the abodes of the company of the Liar. For he is himself
a Liar, who is very good to a Liar, he is a righteous man to whom
a righteous man is dear, since thou hast created men's Selves
in the beginning, O Ahura.

7. Whom, O Mazda, can one appoint as protector for one like me,
when the Liar sets himself to injure me, other than Thy Fire and
Thy Thought, through actions of which twain the Right will come
to maturity, O Ahura? In this lore do thou instruct my very self.

8. Whoso is minded to injure my possessions, from his actions
may no harm come to me! Back upon himself may they come with hostility,
against his own person, all the hostile (acts), to keep him far
from the Good Life, Mazda, not from the ill!

9. Who is it, the faithful man he, who first taught that we honor
thee as mightiest to help, as the holy righteous Lord over action?
What thy Right made known, what the Ox-Creator made known to Right,
they would fain hear through thy Good Mind.

10. Whoso, man or woman, doeth what thou, Mazda Ahura, knowest
as best in life, as destiny for what is Right (give him) the Dominion
through Good Thought. And those whom I impel to your adoration,
with all these will I cross the Bridge of the Separator.

11. By their dominion the Karapans and the Kavis accustomed mankind
to evil actions, so as to destroy Life. Their own soul and their
own self shall torment them when they come where the Bridge of
the Separator is, to all time dwellers in the House of the Lie.

12. When among the laudable descendants and posterity of the Turanian
Fryana the Right ariseth, through activity of Piety that blesseth
substance; then shall Good Thought admit them, and Mazda Ahura
give them protection at the Fulfillment.

13. Whoso among mortals has pleased Spitama Zarathushtra by his
willingness, a man deserving of good fame, to him shall Mazda
Ahura give Life, to him shall Good Thought increase substance,
him we account to be a familiar friend with your Right.

14. O Zarathushtra, what righteous man is thy friend for the great
covenant? Who wills to have good fame? It is the Kava Vishtaspa
at the consummation. Those whom thou wilt unite in one house with
thee, these will I call with words of Good Thought.

15. Ye Haechataspa Spitamas, I will declare unto ye so that ye
can discern the wise and the unwise. ... Through these actions
ye shall acquire Right according to the primeval laws of Ahura.

16. Frashaoshtra Hvogva, go thou thither with those faithful whom
we both desire to be in blessedness, where with Right is united
Piety, where the Dominion is in possession of Good Thought, where
Mazda Ahura dwells to give it increase.

17. When, O Jamaspa Hvogva, when I recount your wrongs not your
successes, (and) with your obedience the prayers of your loyalty,
(before him) who shall separate the wise and the unwise through
his prudent counselor the Right, even he, Mazda Ahura.

18. He that holds unto me, to him I promise what is best in my
possession through the Good Thought, but enmities to him that
shall set himself to devise enmity to us, O Mazda and the Right,
desiring to satisfy your will. That is the decision of my understanding
and thought.

19. He who accomplisheth for me, even Zarathushtra, in accordance
with Right that which best agrees with my will, to him as earning
the reward of the Other Life shall be that of two pregnant cows,
with all things whereon his mind is set. These things will thou
bring to pass for me who best knowest how, O Mazda.

  Divine Songs of Zarathushtra</i>.
  Notes in square brackets [] were added by JHP.

1. For his holy Spirit and for Best Thought, deed, and word,
in accordance with Right Mazda Ahura with Dominion and Piety shall
give us Welfare and Immortality.

2. The best (work) of this most holy Spirit he fulfills with
the tongue through words of Good Thought, with work of his hands
through the action of Piety, by virtue of this knowledge: he,
even Mazda, is the Father of Right.

3. Thou art the holy Father of this Spirit, which has created
for us the luck-bringing cattle, and for its pasture to give it
peace (has created) Piety, when he had taken counsel, O Mazda,
with Good Thought.

4. From this Spirit have Liars fallen away, O Mazda, but not
the Righteous. Whether one is lord of little or of much, he is
to show love to the righteous, but be ill unto the Liar.

5. And all the best things which by this Holy Spirit thou hast
promised to the righteous, O Mazda Ahura, shall the Liar partake
of them without thy will, who by his actions is on the side of
Ill Thought?

6. Through this holy Spirit, Mazda Ahura, and through the Fire
thou wilt give the division of good to the two parties, with support
of Piety and Right. This verily will convert many who are ready
to hear.

 - CHAPTER 48

1. When at the Recompensings the Right shall smite the Liar,
so that what was long since made known shall be assigned to eternity
to Daevas and men, then will it exalt with thy blessings, Ahura,
him who prays to thee.

2. Tell me, for thou art he that knows, O Ahura: - shall the
Righteous smite the Liar before the retributions come which thou
hast conceived? That were indeed a message to bless the world.

3. For him that knows, that is the best of teachings which the
beneficent Ahura teaches through the Right, he the holy one, even
thyself, O Mazda, that knows the secret lore through the wisdom
of Good Thought.

4. Whoso, O Mazda, makes his thought (now) better, (now) worse,
and likewise his Self by action and by word, and follows his own
inclinations, wishes, and choices, he shall in thy purpose be
in a separate place at last.

5. Let good rulers rule us, not evil rulers with the actions
of the Good Lore, O Piety! Perfect thou for man, O thou most good,
the future birth, and for the cow skilled husbandry. Let her grow
fat for our nourishing.

6. She (Armaiti) will give us peaceful dwelling, she will give
lasting life and strength, she the beloved of Good Thought. For
it (the cattle) Mazda Ahura made the plants to grow at the birth
of the First Life, through Right.

7. Violence must be put down! against cruelty make a stand, ye
who would make sure of the reward of Good Thought through Right,
to whose company the holy man belongs. His dwelling place shall
be in thy House, O Ahura.

8. Is the possession of thy good Dominion, Mazda, is that of
thy Destiny assured to me Ahura? Will thy manifestation, O thou
Right, be welcome to the pious, even the weighing of actions by
the Good Spirit [Spenta Mainyu -JHP]?

9. When shall I know whether ye have power, O Mazda and Right,
over everyone whose destructiveness is a menace to me? Let the
revelation of Good Thought be confirmed unto me; the future deliverer
should know how his own destiny shall be.

10. When, O Mazda, will the nobles understand the message? When
will thou smite the filthiness of this intoxicant, through which
the Karapans evilly deceive, and the wicked lords of the lands
with purpose fell?<sup>1</sup>


   + NOTE: 1. Martin Schwartz tr: "When will they ban(ish) the filth
  of that ditch/reciprocity-gift whereby ... the karapans commit
  plunder", 'thus Yasna 48.10 contains no reference to intoxication,
  let alone condemnation of haoma.' Flattery: 'the passage ... has
  nothing remotely to do with sauma.' (Flattery & Schwartz,
  <i>Haoma and Harmaline</i>, 1989, pp. 105, 6.)


11. When, O Mazda, shall Piety come with Right, with Dominion
the happy dwelling rich with pasture? Who are they that will make
peace with the bloodthirsty Liars? To whom will the Lore of Good
Thought come?

12. These shall be the deliverers [Saoshyants -JHP] of the provinces, who exert
themselves, O Good Thought in their action, O Asha, to fulfill
their duty, face to face with thy command, O Mazda. For these
are the appointed smiters of Violence.

 - CHAPTER 49

1. Ever has Bendva been for me the greatest obstacle, I who desire
to give satisfaction to those who are neglected, O Right, O Mazda.
With good Ada come to me, support me firmly. Prepare for him (his)
ruin, O Good Thought.

2. The perverter of this Bendva has long time impeded me, the
Liar who has fallen away from Right. He cares not that holy Piety
should be his, nor takes the counsel with Good Thought, O Mazda.

3. And in this belief (of ours), O Mazda, Right is laid down,
for blessing, in the heresy the Lie, for ruin. Therefore I strive
for the fellowship of Good Thought, I forbid all intercourse with
the Liar.

4. They who make the increase of violence and cruelty with their
tongues, the foes of cattle-nurture among its friends; whose ill
deeds prevail, not their good deeds: these (shall be) in the house
of the Daevas, (the place for) the Self of the Liar.

5. But he, O Mazda, - happiness and satiety be his who links
his own Self with Good Thought, being through Right an intimate
of Piety. And with all these (may I be) in Thy Dominion, Ahura.

6. I beseech you twain, O Mazda and the Right, to say what are
the plans of your will, that we may discern how we might teach
the Religion of such as you, O Ahura.

7. And this let Good Thought hear, O Mazda, let the Right hear,
do thou also listen, O Ahura, which men of the brotherhood, what
noble is it according to the Law who brings to the community fame.

8. On Frashaoshtra do thou bestow the most gladsome fellowship
with the Right - this I ask thee, O Mazda Ahura - and on myself
the hold on what is good in thy Dominion. To all eternity we would
be thy messengers.

9. Let the helper hear the ordinance, he that is created to bring
deliverance. The man of right words is no regarder of fellowship
with the Liar, if they that are partakers of Right are to make
their Selves partake in the best reward at the Judgment, O Jamaspa.

10. And this, O Mazda, will I put in thy care within thy House
- the Good Thought and the souls of the Righteous, their worship,
their Piety and zeal, that thou mayst guard it, O thou mighty
Dominion, with abiding power.

11. But these that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil
words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars, the Souls go to meet
them with evil food; in the House of the Lie they shall be meet
inhabitants.

12. What help hast thou, O Right, for Zarathushtra that calls
upon me? What hast thou, Good Thought? — for me who with praises
seeks your favor, O Mazda Ahura, longing for that which is best
in your possession.

 - CHAPTER 50

1. (Zarathushtra:) Can my soul count on any one for help? Who
is there found for my herd, who for myself a protector, indeed,
at my call other than the Right and thyself. O Mazda Ahura, and
the Best Thought?

2. How, O Mazda, should one desire the luck-bringing cattle,
one who would fain it would come to him with the pasture?
(Mazda:) They that live uprightly according to the Right among
the many that look upon the sun, those whom they stand in judgment,
I will settle in the dwellings of the wise.

3. (Zarathushtra:) So this (reward) shall come to him through
the Right, O Mazda, (this reward) which by the Dominion and Good
Thought he promised, whomsoever by the power of his Destiny prospers
the neighboring possession that now the Liar holds.

4. I will worship you with praise, O Mazda Ahura, joined with
Right and Best Thought and Dominion, that they, desired of pious
men, may stand as Judges on the path of the obedient unto the
House of Song.

5. Assured by you, O Mazda Ahura and Right, are the pointings
of the hand - since you are well-disposed to your prophet - which
shall bring us to bliss, together with visible manifest help.

6. The prophet Zarathushtra, O Mazda, who lifts up his voice
in worship, as friend of Asha - may the Creator of Wisdom teach
me his ordinances through Good Thought, that my tongue may have
a pathway.

7. For you I will harness the swiftest steeds, stout and strong,
by the promptings of your praise, that ye may come hither, O Mazda,
Right, and Good thought.

8. Ever with verses that are recognized as those of pious zeal
I will come before you with outstretched hands, O Mazda, before
you, O thou Right, with worship of the faithful man, before you
with all the capacity of Good Thought.

9. With those prayers I would come and praise you, O Mazda and
thou Right, with actions of Good Thought. If I be master of my
own destiny as I will, then will I take thought for the portion
of the wise in the same.

10. Those actions that I shall achieve and those done aforetime,
and those, O Good Thought, that are precious in thy sight, the
rays of the sun, the shimmering uprisings of the days, all is
for your praise, O thou Right and Mazda Ahura.

11. Your praiser, Mazda, will I declare myself and be, so long,
O Right, as I have strength and power. May the Creator of the
world accomplish through Good Thought its fulfillment of all that
most perfectly answers to his will.

 - CHAPTER 51

  + NOTE:  Translation by Bartholomae, from I.J.S. Taraporewala, <i>The
  Divine Songs of Zarathushtra</i>.

1. The good, the precious Dominion, as a most surpassing portion,
shall Right achieve for him that with zeal accomplishes what is
best through his actions, O Mazda. This will I now work out for
us.

2. Before all, O Mazda Ahura, assure me the Dominion of your
possession, O Right, and what is thine, O Piety. Your (Dominion)
of blessing give through Good Thought to him that prays.

3. Let your ears attend to those who in their deeds and utterances
hold to your words, Ahura and Right, to those of Good Thought,
for whom thou, Mazda, art the first teacher.

4. Where is the recompense for wrong to be found, where pardon
for the same? Where shall they attain the Right? Where is the
holy Piety, where Best Thought? Thy Dominions, where are they,
O Mazda?

5. All this (I) ask, whether the husbandman shall find cattle
in accordance with Right, he that is perfect in action, a man
of understanding, when he prays to him, who hath promised unto
the Wise the true Judge, in that he is Lord of the two destinies...

6. Even he, Ahura Mazda, who through his Dominion appoints what
is better than good to him that is attached to his will, but what
is worse than evil to him that obeys him not, at the last end
of life.

7. Give me, O thou that didst create the Ox and Waters and Plants,
Welfare and Immortality, by the Highest Spirit, O Mazda, strength
and continuance through Good Thought at the (Judge's) sentence.

8. Of these two things will I speak, O Mazda, - for one may speak
to the wise, - the ill that is threatened to the Liar, and the
happiness of him who clings to the Right. For he, the Prophet,
is glad of every one who says this to the wise.

9. What recompense thou wilt give to the two parties by thy red
Fire, by the molten metal, give us a sign of it in our souls -
even the bringing of ruin to the Liar, of blessing to the Righteous.

10. Whoso, other than this one, seeks to kill me, Mazda, he is
a son of the Lie's creation, ill-willed thus towards all that
live. I call the Right to come to me with good destiny.

11. What man is friend to Spitama Zarathushtra, O Mazda? Who will
let himself be counseled by Right? With whom is holy Piety? Or
who as an upright man is intent on the brotherhood of Good Thought?

12. The Kavi's wanton did not please Zarathushtra Spitama at the
Winter Gate, in that he stayed him from taking refuge with him,
and when there came to him also (Zarathushtra's) two steeds shivering
with cold.

13. Thus the Self of the Liar destroys for himself the assurance
of the right Way; whose soul shall tremble at the Revelation on
the Bridge of the Separator, having turned aside with deeds and
tongue from the Path of Right.

14. The Karapans will not obey the statutes and ordinances concerning
husbandry. For the pain they inflict upon the cattle, fulfill
upon them through their actions and judgments that judgment which
at the last shall bring them to the House of the Lie.

15. When Zarathushtra hath promised to the men of his brotherhood,
(which) in the House of Song Ahura Mazda hath first attained,
for all this I have looked through your blessings, Good Thought,
and those of Right.

16. Kavi Vishtaspa hath the creed which the holy Mazda Ahura with
Right hath devised, together with the dominion of the Brotherhood,
and the path of Good Thought. So be it accomplished after our
desire.

17. The fair form of one that is dear hath Frashaoshtra Hvogva
promised unto me: may sovereign Mazda Ahura grant that she attain
possession of the Right for her good Self.

18. This creed Jamaspa Hvogva chooses through Right, lordly in
substance. This Dominion they (choose) who have part in Good Thought.
This grant me, Ahura, that they may find in thee, Mazda, their
protection.

19. The man himself, O Maidyoi-Maungha Spitama, hath set this
before him after conceiving it in his own self. He that would
see life indeed, to him will he make known what in actions by
Mazda's ordinance is better during (this) existence.

20. Your blessings shall ye give us, all that are one in will,
with whom Right, Good Thought, Piety, and Mazda (are one) according
to promise, giving your aid when worshipped with reverence.

21. By Piety the man becomes Holy. Such person advances Right
through his thinking, his words, his action, his Self. By Good
Thought Mazda Ahura will give the Dominion. For this good Destiny
I long.

22. He, I ween, that Mazda Ahura knoweth among all that have been
and are, as one to whom in accordance with Right the best portion
falls for his prayer, these will I reverence by their own names
and go before them with honor.

 - CHAPTER 52

<h4>A PRAYER FOR SANCTITY AND ITS BENEFITS.</h4>

  + NOTE:  Translated by L. H. Mills (From <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>,
  American Edition, 1898.)

1. I pray with benedictions for a benefit, and for the good,
even for the entire creation of the holy (and the clean); I beseech
for them for the (generation which is) now alive, for that which
is just coming into life, and for that which shall be hereafter.
And (I pray for that) sanctity which leads to prosperity, and
which has long afforded shelter, which goes on hand in hand with
it, which joins it in its walk, and of itself becoming its close
companion as it delivers forth its precepts, (2) bearing every
form of healing virtue which comes to us in waters, appertains
to cattle, or is found in plants, and overwhelming, all the harmful
malice of the Daevas, (and their servants) who might harm this
dwelling and its lord, (3) bringing good gifts, and better blessings,
given very early, and later (gifts), leading to successes, and
for a long time giving shelter. And so the greatest, and the best,
and most beautiful benefits of sanctity fall likewise to our lot
(4) for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and the praise of
the Bountiful Immortals, for the bringing prosperity to this abode,
and for the prosperity of the entire creation of the holy, and
the clean, (and as for this, so) for the opposition of the entire
evil creation. (And I pray for this) as I praise through Righteousness,
I who am beneficent, those who are (likewise of a better mind).

5-8. (See Y8.5-8.)

<h2 id="y53">Vahishtoishti Gatha</h2>

  - CHAPTER 53.

  + NOTE:  Translation by Bartholomae, from I.J.S. Taraporewala, <i>The
  Divine Songs of Zarathushtra</i>.


1. (Zarathushtra) - The best possession known is of Zarathushtra
Spitama, which is that Mazda Ahura will give him through Right
the glories of blessed life unto all time, and likewise to them
that practice and learn the words and actions of his Good Religion.

2. Then let them seek the pleasure of Mazda with thoughts, words,
and actions, unto him praise gladly, and seek his worship, even
Kava Vishtaspa, and Zarathushtra's son, the Spitamid, with Frashaoshtra,
making straight the paths for the Religion of the future Deliverer
which Ahura ordained.

3. Him, O Pouruchista, thou scion of Haechataspa and Spitama,
youngest of Zarathushtra's daughters, hath (Zarathushtra) appointed
as one to enjoin on them the fellowship with Good Thought, Right,
and Mazda. So take counsel with thine own understanding, with
good insight practice the holiest works of Piety.

4. (Jamaspa): Earnestly will I lead her to the Faith, that she
may serve her father and her husband, the farmers and the nobles,
as a righteous woman (serving) the righteous. The glorious heritage
of Good Thought ... shall Mazda Ahura give to her for all time.

5. (Zarathushtra): Teachings address I to maidens marrying, and
to you (bridegrooms) giving counsel. Lay them to heart and learn
to get them within your Selves in earnest attention to the Life
of Good Thought. Let each of you strive to excel the other in
the Right, for it will be a prize for that one.

6. So is it in fact, ye men and women! Whatever happiness ye
look for in the follower of the (...) that will be snatched away
from his person. To them the Liars, crying 'woe', shall be ill-food,
paradise shall be lost to them that despite righteousness. In
such wise ye destroy for yourselves the Spiritual Life.

7. And to you shall accrue the reward of the Brotherhood - in
so far as the most faithful zeal is in your flesh and blood -
there where the spirit of the Liar, cringing and cowering, shall
fall down into destruction. If you separate yourselves from the
Brotherhood, then will 'woe!' be your word at the end of things.

8. So they whose deeds are evil, let them be deceived, and let
them all howl, abandoned to ruin. Through good rulers let him
bring death and bloodshed upon them and peace from these (their
assaults) unto the happy villagers. Grief let him bring on those,
he that is the greatest, with the lord of death; and soon let
it be.

9. To men of evil creed belongs the place of corruption. They
that set themselves to contemn the worthy, despising righteousness,
forfeiting their own body. - Where is the Righteous Lord who shall
rob them of life and freedom? Thine Mazda is the Dominion, whereby
thou canst give to the right-living poor man the better portion.

<hr>

 - CHAPTER 54. The Airyema-Ishyo

1. Let the Airyaman, the desired friend and peersman, draw near
for grace to the men and to the women who are taught of Zarathushtra,
for the joyful grace of the Good Mind, whereby the conscience
may attain its wished-for recompense. I pray for the sacred reward
of the ritual order which is (likewise so much) to be desired;
and may Ahura Mazda grant it, (or cause it to increase).

2. We sacrifice to the Airyema-ishyo, the powerful, the victoriously
smiting, the opponent of assaulting malice, the greatest of the
sentences of the holy ritual order. And we sacrifice to the bounteous
Gathas that rule supreme in the ritual, the holy (and august).
And we sacrifice to the Praises of the Yasna which were the productions
of the world of old.

 - CHAPTER 55

<h4>THE WORSHIP OF THE GATHAS AS CONCLUDED, THAT OF THE STAOTA
YESNYA AS BEGINNING.</h4>

1. We present hereby and we make known, as our offering to the
bountiful Gathas which rule (as the leading chants) within (the
appointed times and seasons of) the Ritual, all our landed riches,
and our persons, together with our very bones and tissues, our
forms and forces, our consciousness, our soul, and Fravashi.

2. That which Gathas (may) be to us, which are our guardians
and defenders, and our spiritual food, yea, which (may) be to
our souls both food and clothing, such are these Gathas to us,
guardians, and defenders, and (spiritual) food, even such they
are, both food and clothing to the soul.
And (may) they be to us (for this our offering) abundant givers
of rewards, and just and righteous ones, for the world beyond
the present, after the parting of our consciousness and body.
3. And may these (Praises of the Offering) come forth, and appear
for us with power and victorious assault, with health and healing,
with progress, and with growth, with preparation and protection,
with beneficence and sanctity, and abounding with gifts toward
him who can understand; yea, let them appear (with free liberality
to the enlightened), let them appear as Mazda, the most beneficent,
has produced them, He the one who is victorious when He smites,
and who helps the settlements advance, for the protection, and
the guarding of the religious order of the settlements which are
now being furthered, and of those which shall bring salvation
to us, and for the protection of the entire creation of the holy
(and the clean).

4. And may'st thou, (O Asha! who abidest within the Gathas),
give to every holy man who comes with this prayer for a blessing,
and endeavoring to help himself, according to his good thoughts,
and words, and deeds.

5. We are therefore worshipping both the (divine) Righteousness
and the Good Mind, and the bountiful Gathas, that rule as the
leading chants within (the times and the seasons of) the holy
ritual order.

6. And we worship the Praises of the Yasna which were the production
of the ancient world, those which are (now) recollected and put
in use, those which are now learned and taught, those which are
being held (in mind, and so) repeated, those remembered and recited,
and those worshipped, and thus the ones which further the world
through grace in its advance.
And we worship the part(s) of the Praises of the Yasna, and their
recitation as it is heard, even their memorized recital, and their
chanting, and their offering (as complete).

the Righteous Order to perfect and to incite us. Yea, we worship
Sraosha the blessed and the stately, who smites with victory,
and who furthers the settlements in their advance, the holy lord
of the ritual order.

<h4>THE SROSH YASHT.</h4>

1. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best, &c.

are (both) creating all things in the creation.

3. For his splendor and his glory, for his might, and the blow
which smites with victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of

done (in times gone by), and those which are yet to be done (for
him in times to come).

middle of the thighs, for the Bountiful Immortals, for their worship,
and their homage, and their propitiation, and their praise.
For his splendor and his glory, for his might, and the blow which
smites with victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of the

the weaker.
For his splendor and his glory, for his might....

For his splendor and his glory, for his might....

<h4>VI.</h4>

13. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, who is the strongest
and most persistent of the youths, the most energetic, and the
swiftest, who of all the youths strikes most with terror I from
afar (?). [Be ye desirous, O ye Mazdayasnians! of the Yasna of
Obedience the blessed.]

14. Far from this house, this village, and this tribe, and from
this country, the evil and destructive terrors (shall) depart.
In the dwelling of that man in whose abode Obedience the blessed,
who smites victoriously, is satisfied and welcomed, there is that
holy man who thus contents him (most) forward in the thinking
better thoughts, in the speaking truthful ritual) words, and in
the doing holy deeds.
For his splendor and his glory, for his might....

all the migrations (?) of the tribes.

16. Who sleeplessly and vigilant guards the creatures of Ahura,
who sleeplessly and with vigilance saves them, who with halberd
raised on high guards all the corporeal world after setting of
the sun, (17) who has never slept in quiet since the two Spirits
made the worlds, [the bounteous and the evil one] who guards the
homes of Asha, who battles all (?) the days long and the nights
with all the Daevas [(Pazand) the Mazanian], (18) nor terror-stricken

and of every brilliant form, which abounds in many an explanation
and revelation of the word, who has the first place in the Mathra.

For his splendor and his glory, for his might....

<h4>IX.</h4>

21. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, whose house stands
with its thousand pillars, as victorious, on the highest height
of high Haraiti, self-lighted from within, star-studded from without,

And in this Religion, Ahura Mazda has been confessed with faith,
and the Good Mind likewise with Him, and Righteousness the Best,

Weal and Immortality; and the question to the Lord is asked, and
Mazda's lore (is written).

25. O Sraosha (Obedience), thou blessed one, and stately! protect
us for the lives; yea, for both, (for that) of this world which
is corporeal, and for the world of mind, against unhappy death,
and the remorseless Wrath of rapine, against the hosts with ill-intent,
who lift their bloody spears against us; yea, against their assaults
whom the Wrath-demon will set on, and Vidhatu, demon-made. 26.
Therefore may'st thou, O Sraosha, the blessed and the stately!
grant swiftness to our teams, soundness to our bodies, and abundant
observation of our foes, and their smiting (as we mark them),
and their sudden death.
For his splendor and his glory, for his might....

<h4>XI.</h4>

27. We worship Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, whom four racers
draw in harness, white and shining, beautiful, and powerful, quick
to learn, and fleet, obeying before speech, heeding orders from
the mind, with their hoofs of horn gold-covered, (28) fleeter
than (our) horses, swifter than the winds, more rapid than the
rain(-drops as they fall); yea, fleeter than the clouds, or well-winged
birds, or the we shot arrow as it flies, (29) which overtake these
swift ones all, as they fly after them pursuing, but which are
never overtaken when they flee, which plunge away from both the
weapons (hurled on this side and on that) and draw Sraosha with
them, the good Sraosha and the blessed; which from both the weapons
(those on this side and on that) bear the good Obedience the blessed,
plunging forward in their zeal, when he takes his course from
India on the East, and when he lights down in the West.
For his splendor and his glory, for his might....

<h4>XII.</h4>

30. We worship Obedience the blessed and the stately, who though
lofty and so high, yea, even to the girdle, yet stoops to Mazda's
creatures, (31) who thrice within the day, and three times of
a night, will drive on to that Karshvar Hvaniratha, called the
luminous, as he holds in both the hands and poizes his knife-like
battle-ax, which flies as of itself, and to cleave the Daevas'
skulls, (32) to hew down Angra Mainyu, the wicked, and to hew

him who smites with victory, both here and not here, and on this
entire earth. And we worship all the (gifts) of Sraosha (Obedience)

Yea, we worship (all the martial gifts) of Sraosha (Obedience)

of hand, skull-cleaver of the Daevas, conquering the endowments
of the conqueror, the holy conqueror of the conqueror, and (his)
victorious powers, and he Ascendancy which it bestows, and we
worship this Ascendancy of Sraosha's (the same which conquers
theirs); and that of Arshti do we praise as well. 34. And every
house by Sraosha guarded do we worship, wherein the blessed friendly
Sraosha is befriended and made welcome, where the holy man is
far advanced (?) in holy thoughts, and righteous words and deeds.

For his splendor and his glory, for his might, which smites with
victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of the Yazads, with
a Yasna loud-intoned, him Obedience the blessed, with the consecrated
waters, and the good Blessedness, the lofty, and Nairya-sangha,
the stately, and may he come to us to aid us, he who smites with
victory, Obedience the blessed!

 - CHAPTER 58

<h4>THE FSHUSHO MATHRA.</h4>

1. (Introduction.) (To the increase of our homage and praise
of God) we offer this service which, as our defense, may shield
us, which is worship with its beneficent results; and Blessedness
is with it of a verity, and Piety as well. [ (Pazand) and of this
worship the results here mentioned are the well-thought thought,
the word well spoken, and the deed well done]; and let this our
worship shelter us from the Daeva and from the evil-minded man.
2. And to this worship do we confide our settlements and persons
for protection and care, for guarding, and for oversight; (3)
and in this worship will we abide, O Ahura Mazda! and with joy.

In this worship do we exercise our choices; and to it will we
approach, and to it will we belong; yea, to revering worship will
we confide our settlements and persons for protection, and for
care, for guarding, and for oversight, to such worship as is the
praise of such as You.

<h3>MATHRA.</h3>

4. The owner of herds is the righteous (one), and he is victorious
when he strikes, and thus he is the best; [(Pazand) we therefore
offer (this) service (for herd-owners)] for the herd-owner is
the father of the Kine by the help of him who follows the ritual
order: and he is the father of the holy man as well, and of the
sanctified creation. He is in verity the bestower of blessings,
and to him, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! we render, (and his do we
make) Your greatness, Your goodness, and Your (spiritual) beauty,
and let this man, the cattle-owner, approach to guard over us;
and may he be our watchman together with the Righteous Order,
and with store for our nourishment and full generous liberality,
together with sharing of the goods, with gentleness, and with
Ahura Mazda's sacred Fire!

5. O Ye Bountiful Immortals! as Ye have made us, so do Ye save
us, holy men, and saintly women (as we are, and steadfast in the
faith)l. Save us, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! Ye who rule aright,
and who dispose (of all) aright, for none other do I know, save
You; then with Your Righteousness do Ye save us.

6. And we offer hereby our thoughts, and words, and actions,
our herds, and men, to the Bountiful Spirit. And may the creative
stars of Ahura Mazda, the Creator, shine down on us, and round
about us with full herds and healthy settlements, with healthy
herds and healthy men, and with all in vigor, and endowed with
the blessing of the Lord. 7. Praise to Thee, O Fire of Ahura Mazda
I may'st thou come to (us in) the greatest one of the engrossing
interests for the help of the great (effort), for the joy-producing
grace of the great (interest of our cause); grant us both Weal
and Deathlessness!

8. We sacrifice to the entire collection of the Praises of the
Yasna, with the careful structure of their language which has
reached the most its object. And we offer (our homage) in our
celebrations to Thy body, O Ahura Mazda! the most beautiful of
forms, these stars, and to that one, the highest of the high [(Pazand)
such as the sun was called]. Yea, we worship the Praises of the
Yasna which were the production of the world of old.

 - CHAPTER 59

<h4>MUTUAL BLESSINGS.</h4>

1-17. (See Y17.1-17.)

18-27. (See Y26.1-10.)

28. We worship Verethraghna, the Ahura-made, the victorious blow;
and we worship the Saoshyant, who smites with victory; and we
sacrifice to this Baresman with its Zaothra and its girdle (which
is its band) and which is spread with sanctity. And we sacrifice
to (our) own soul(s), and to (our) own Fravashi(s).

29. (See Y17.19.)

30. (The Ratu speaks): O thou good (servant of the Lord)! may
that be thine which is better than the good; may'st thou acquire
that which is (thine) own in the Zaothra; may'st thou attain to
that reward which the Zaotar has been obtaining, who is far advanced
in his good thoughts, and words, and deeds.

31. (The Zaotar speaks): May that happen to you (likewise) which
is better than the good, and may that not happen which is worse
than the evil, and may that likewise not be my lot. 32. As (our)
Ahu (is) excellent, so (is our) Ratu (one who rules) from his
Righteousness, a creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions
done for Mazda, and the Kingdom (is) to Ahura which to the poor
will offer a nurturer. A blessing is Asha called the Best, &c.
We sacrifice to the Ahuna-vairya; we sacrifice to Asha Vahishta
the most beautiful, the Bountiful Immortal. And we sacrifice to
the Fshusho-mathra, the by-spoken. And we sacrifice to the entire
collection of the Praises of the Yasna; (yea), to the Yasna Praises
which were instituted in the world of yore.

 - CHAPTER 60

<h4>PRAYERS FOR THE DWELLING OF THE SACRIFICER.</h4>

1. Thus that better than the good may he approach, who shows
to us straight paths of profit appertaining to this bodily life
and to the mental likewise, in the eternal (?) realms where dwells
Ahura; yea, may he approach it, who is Thy worthy servant, and
good citizen, O Great giver Lord!

2. May these blessings approach this house, which are the wise
perceptions of the saints, the sacred blessings bestowed through
the ritual, their guileless characteristics, together with their
recognition of what is due; and may the Righteous Order appear
for this village, and the Divine Sovereign Power, together with
the benefit and glorious welfare (which ensues),

3. And with these the long enduring prominence of this Religion
of Ahura's, the Zarathushtrian Faith. And may the Kine be now
with greatest speed within (the farm-yard of) this house, most
speedily may the rewarded sanctity and the strength of the holy
man be here, most speedily as well Ahura's lore. 4. And may the
good and heroic and bountiful Fravashis of the saints come here,
and may they go hand in hand with us with the healing virtues
of (their) blessed gifts as wide-spread as the earth, as far-spread
as the rivers, as high-reaching as the sun, for the furtherance
of the better men, for the hindrance of the hostile, and for the
abundant growth of riches and of glory.

5. May Sraosha (Obedience) conquer disobedience within this house,
and may peace triumph over discord here, and generous giving over
avarice, reverence over contempt, speech with truthful words over
lying utterance. May the Righteous Order gain the victory over
the Demon of the Lie.

6. As in this (house) the Bountiful Immortals seek for good Yasnas
and good praises from the blessed Sraosha (who governs here),
and as they seek for (one) good sacrifice and act of homage (more
especially their own) which is a good offering (to them) for (our)
salvation, and a good offering in praise, together with a long
continued offering of the entire self, (7) let not then (their)
brilliant glory ever desert this house, nor the bright abundance,
nor an illustrious offspring legitimately born, nor that long
continued companionship which is the furtherance of that good
blessedness which teaches concerning glory.

8-10. (= Y8.5-7).

11. In order that our minds may be delighted, and our souls the
best, let our bodies be glorified as well, and let them; O Mazda!
go likewise openly (unto Heaven) as the best world of the saints
as devoted to Ahura, (12) and accompanied by Asha Vahishta (who
is Righteousness the Best), and the most beautiful! And may we
see Thee, and may we, approaching, come around about Thee, and
attain to entire companionship with Thee! And we sacrifice to
the Righteous Order, the best, the most beautiful, the bounteous
Immortal!

 - CHAPTER 61

1. Let us peal forth the Ahuna-vairya in our liturgy between
the heaven and earth, and let us send forth the Asha Vahishta
in our prayer the same, and the Yenhe hatam. And let us send forth
in our liturgies between the heaven and earth the pious and good
prayer of the pious man for blessings, (2) for the encounter with,
and for the displacement of Angra Mainyu with his creatures which
are likewise evil as he is, for he is filled with death (for those
whom he has made). Aye, let us send that petition forth for the
encounter with, and for the dislodgment of the Kahvaredhas and
of the individual Kahvaredha the male, and the female (to the
last individual of each), (3) and for the encounter with, and
the dislodgment of the Kayadhas, and of the individual Kayadhians,
male and female, and of the thieves and robbers, of the Zandas,
and the sorcerers, of the covenant breakers, and of those who
tamper with the covenants. 4. Yea, we send it forth for the encounter
with, and for the overthrow of the murderers of the saints, and
of those who hate and torment us for our Faith, and of those who
persecute the ritual, and the tyrant full of death. Yea, let us
peal them forth for the encounter with and the overthrow of the
wicked, O Zarathushtra Spitama! whoever they may be, whose thoughts,
and words, and works are not congenial to the holy ritual laws.

5. And how shall we drive the Demon of the Lie from hence from
us? Aye, how shall we, the prophets who are yet to serve and save
(thy people), drive the Druj from hence, so that we, having power
over her as being utterly without power, may drive her hence with
blow from the seven Karshvars, for the encounter with, and for
the dislodgment of the entire evil world?

 - CHAPTER 62

<h4>TO THE FIRE.</h4>

1. I offer my sacrifice and homage to thee, the Fire, as a good
offering, and an offering with our hail of salvation, even as
an offering of praise with benedictions, to thee, the Fire, O
Ahura Mazda's son! Meet for sacrifice art thou, and worthy of
(our) homage. And as meet for sacrifice, and thus worthy of our
homage, may'st thou be in the houses of men (who worship Mazda).
Salvation be to this man who worships thee in verity and truth,
with wood in hand, and Baresman ready, with flesh in hand, and
holding too the mortar. 2. And may'st thou be (ever) fed with
wood as the prescription orders. Yea, may'st thou have thy perfume
justly, and thy sacred butter without fail, and thine andirons
regularly placed. Be of full-age as to thy nourishment, of the
canon's age as to the measure of thy food, O Fire, Ahura-Mazda's
son! 3. Be now aflame within this house; be ever without fail
in flame; be all ashine within this house; be on thy growth within
this house; for long time be thou thus to the furtherance of the
heroic (renovation), to the completion of (all) progress, yea,
even till the good heroic (millennial) time when that renovation
shall have become complete. 4. Give me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's
son! a speedy glory, speedy nourishment, and speedy booty, and
abundant glory, abundant nourishment, abundant booty, an expanded
mind, and nimbleness of tongue for soul and understanding, even
an understanding continually growing in its largeness, and that
never wanders, and long enduring virile power, (5) an offspring
sure of foot, that never sleeps on watch [not for a third part
of the day, or night], and that rises quick from bed, and likewise
a wakeful offspring, helpful to nurture, or reclaim, legitimate,
keeping order in men's meetings, (yea,) drawing men to assemblies
through their influence and word, grown to power, skillful, redeeming
others from oppression, served by many followers, which may advance
my line (in prosperity and fame), and (my) Vis, and my Zantu,
and (my) province, (yea, an offspring) which may deliver orders
to the Province as (firm and righteous rulers). 6. And may'st
thou grant me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's Son! that whereby instructors
may be (given) me, now and for evermore, (giving light to me of
Heaven) the best life of the saints, brilliant, all glorious.
And may I have experience of the good reward, and the good renown,
and of the long forecasting preparation of the soul. 7. The Fire
of Ahura Mazda addresses this admonition to all for whom he cooks
the night and morning (meal). From all these, O Spitama! he wishes
to secure good care, and healthful care (as guarding for salvation),
the care of a true praiser. 8. At both the hands of all who come
by me, I, the Fire, keenly look: What brings the mate to his mate
(thus I say to him), the one who walks at large, to him who sits
at home? [We worship the bounteous Fire, the swift-driving charioteer.]

9. And if this man who passes brings him wood brought (with good
measure that is) with sacred care, or if he brings the Baresman
spread with sanctity, or the Hadhanaepata plant, then afterwards
Ahura Mazda's Fire will bless him, contented, not offended, and
in (its) satisfaction (saying thus). 10. May a herd of kine be
with thee, and a multitude of men, may an active mind go with
thee, and an active soul as well. As a blest soul may'st thou
live through thy life, the nights which thou shall live. This
is the blessing of the Fire for him who brings it wood (well)
dried, sought out for flaming, purified with the earnest blessing
of the sacred ritual truth. 11. We strive after the flowing on
of the good waters, and their ebb as well, and the sounding of
their waves, desiring their propitiation; I desire to approach
them with my praise.

12. (= Y3.24-25).

 - CHAPTER 65

<h4>TO ARDVI SURA ANAHITA, AND THE WATERS.</h4>

1. I will praise the water Ardvi Sura Anahita, the wide-flowing
(as it is) and healing in its influence, efficacious against the
Daevas, devoted to Ahura's lore, and to be worshipped with sacrifice
within the corporeal world, furthering all living things (?) and
holy, helping on the increase and improvement of our herds and
settlements, holy, and increasing our wealth, holy, and helping
on the progress of the Province, holy (as she is)? 2. (Ardvi Sura
Anahita) who purifies the seed of all male beings, who sanctifies
the wombs of all women to the birth, who makes all women fortunate
in labor, who brings all women a regular and timely flow of milk,
(3) (Ardvi Sura Anahita) with a volume sounding from afar, which
is alone equal in its bulk to all the waters which flow forth
upon earth, which flows down with mighty volume from high Hukairya
to the sea Vouru-kasha. 4. And all the gulfs in Vouru-kasha are
stirred (when it falls down), all the middle doth well up when
Ardvi Sura Anahita rushes in, when she plunges foaming into them,
she, whose are a thousand tributaries, and a thousand outlets,
and each as it flows in, or rushes out, is a forty days' ride
in length to a rider mounted well.

5. And the (chief) outlet to this one water (Ardvi Sura Anahita)
goes apart, dividing to all the seven Karshvars. And this outlet
to my river, Ardvi Sura Anahita, bears off its water always in
summer and in winter. This my river purifies the seed of men,
and wombs of women, and women's milk.

6. Let the saints' Fravashis now draw near, those of the saints
who live, or have lived, of those born, or yet to be born; yea,
let them come near which have borne these waters up stream from
the nearest ones (that lie below as the outlet pours away) 7.
Let not our waters be for the man of ill intent, of evil speech,
or deeds, or conscience; let them not be for the offender of a
friend, not for an insulter of a Magian, nor for one who harms
the workmen, nor for one who hates his kindred. And let not our
good waters (which are not only good, but) best, and Mazda-made,
help on the man who strives to mar our settlements which are not
to be corrupted, nor him who would mar our bodies, (our) uncorrupted
(selves), (8) nor the thief, or bludgeon-bearing ruffian who would
slaughter the disciples, nor a sorcerer, nor a burrier of dead
bodies, nor the jealous, nor the niggard, nor the godless heretic
who slays disciples, nor the evil tyrant among men. Against these
may our waters come as torments. As destructive may these come
(?), may they come to him who has done those first (foul evils),
as to him who does the last.

9. O waters! rest still within your places while the invoking
priest shall offer.
Shall not the invoker make offering to these good waters, and
with the inculcated words? (And how shall this be done?) Shall
he not be tongue-fettered, if he offers else than with the ritual?
Shall (not) the words be so delivered as the Aethrapaiti teaches?
Where shall the blessings be (inserted)? Where the supplications
with confessions? Where the gifts of those that offer? 10. (It
shall be only thus) as Ahura Mazda showed before to Zarathushtra,
and as Zarathushtra taught the corporeal worlds (the men on earth)!
Thou shalt pray the first petition to the waters, O Zarathushtra,
and after that thou shalt offer the Zaothras to the waters, sanctified,
and sought out with pious care; and thou shalt pronounce these
words (as follows, thus): (11) O ye waters, I beseech of you this
favor; and grant ye me this great one in whose bestowal ye flow
down to me for the bettering (of my state), with a never-failing
truth. O ye waters, I beseech of you for wealth of many kinds
(which gives) power (to its holder), and for an offspring self-dependent
whom multitudes will bless, and for whose wasting, or defeat,
or death, or vengeful punishment, or overtaking, no one prays.

12. And this do I beseech of you, O waters, this, O ye lands,
and this, ye plants! This wealth and offspring I beseech of You,
O Ye Bountiful Immortals, who rule aright, who dispose (of all)
aright, O Ye good beings, male and female, givers of good things;
and this I beseech of you, O ye beneficent, mighty, and overwhelming
Fravashis of the saints, and this (of thee), O Mithra of the wide
pastures, and this of thee, O blest and stately Sraosha; and of
thee, O Rashnu the most just, and of thee, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's
son; and of thee, O lofty lord, the royal Apam-napat, of the fleet
horses; aye, of You all, ye Yazads, bestowers of the better gifts
and holy. 13. And this do ye therefore grant me, O ye holy waters,
and ye lands!

14. And grant me likewise what is still greater than this all,
and still better than this all, and more beautiful, and more exceeding
precious (and that is, Immortality and Welfare), O Ye Yazads,
holy and ruling mightily, and powerful at once, and grant it speedily
according to this Gathic (?) word: (Yea), by veritable grace let
that be done (?) for us which is most promotive of our weal. 15.
And according to this further word again: Grant me, Thou who art
maker of the Kine, the plants, and the waters, Immortality and
likewise Weal, O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit. And
grant me these two eternal gifts through Thy Good Mind in the
doctrine.

16-18. (See Y15.2; Y56.3-4.)

 - CHAPTER 66

<h4>TO THE AHURIAN ONE.</h4>

1. I am now offering this Zaothra here with sanctity, together
with the Haoma and the flesh, and the Hadhanaepata lifted up with
sacred regularity as to thee, O Ahurian One, for the propitiation
of Ahura Mazda, of the Bountiful Immortals, of Sraosha (Obedience)
the blessed, and of the Fire of Ahura Mazda, the ritual's lofty
lord.

by 'I offer with sanctity;' see also Y7.24.)

5-7. (See Y38.3-5.)

 - CHAPTER 68

<h4>TO THE AHURIAN ONE, AND THE WATERS.</h4>

1. We offer this to thee, O Ahurian (daughter) of Ahura! as a
help (?) for life. If we have offended thee, let this Zaothra
then attain to thee (for satisfaction), for it is thine with its
Haoma, and its milk, and its Hadhanaepata. 2. And may'st thou
approach to me for milk and for libation, a Zaothra! as health,
for healing, and for progress, for growth and in preparation for
ceremonial merit, for good renown, for equanimity and for that
victory which makes the settlements advance.

3. Yea, we worship thee with sacrifice, O thou Ahurian (daughter)
of Ahura with the Zaothras of the good thought; and we worship,
O Ahura, one with the Zaothras of the good word and deed (4) for
the enlightenment of the thoughts, and words, and actions, for
preparation for the soul, for the settlement's advance, and to
prepare the saints endowed with ritual merit.

5. And grant me, O thou Ahurian One! Heaven, and to have an offspring
manly and legitimate, who may promote my house, my village, my
tribe and province, and the authority thereof.

6. We sacrifice to thee, O thou Ahurian one! And we sacrifice
to the sea Vouru-kasha, and to all waters upon earth, whether
standing, or running, or waters of the well, or spring-waters
which perennially flow, or the drippings of the rains, or the
irrigations of canals. 7. With this hymn from the (spirit of)
the Yasna do we worship thee, and with the homage which it offers
as it is the most legitimate Yasna, and homage of them (all) because
of Righteousness the Best. We sacrifice to the good waters, and
to the best, which Mazda created. 8. And we sacrifice to the two,
to the milk and to the libation, which make the waters flow, and
the plants sprout forth, opposing therein the Dragon Daeva-made,
for the arrest of that cheat the Pairika, and to contradict the
insulting malice of the Ashemaogha (the disturber and destroyer
of our Faith), and of the unholy tyrant full of death, and of
the human Daeva (worshipper) of hateful malice (and intent).

9. And may'st thou hear our sacrificial chants O thou Ahurian
(daughter) of Ahura! Yea, be propitiated by our Yasna, O Ahurian
one! and so may'st thou be present at our Yasna; may'st thou come
to us to help, as we chant our full-offered Yasht with the full
offering of Zaothras.

10. If any man shall sacrifice to you, O ye good waters, the Ahurian
ones of Ahura! with the best and most fitting Zaothras offered
piously, (11) to that man ye give both splendor and glory, with
health and vigor of the body and prominence of form; yea, to him
ye give possessions which entail abundant glory, and a legitimate
scion, and a long enduring life, and (Heaven at the last), the
best life of the saints, shining, all glorious. 12. And to me
also do ye now give it, to me who am offering this Yasna as a
priest.
(Response.) And to us Mazdayasnians who are likewise offering
sacrifice, do ye grant (both the desire and knowledge of the path
that is correct), to us colleagues, and disciples, Aethrapaitis
and Aethryas, men and women as well as children, and maidens of
the field, (13) who think good only, for the overwhelming of oppression
and of malice in the raids of the invader, and in face of foes
who hate. Grant to us both the desire of, and the knowledge of
that straightest path, the straightest because of Righteousness,
and of (Heaven) the best life of the Saints, shining, all glorious.
As the Ahu is excellent, so is the Ratu (one who rules) from the
Righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of life's actions
done for Mazda. And the kingdom (is) for Ahura, which to the poor
may offer nurture.

14. (The Zaotar speaks): I beseech with my benediction for a safe
abode, for a joyful and a long abode for the dwellers in this
village from whence these Zaothras (which I offer come). And I
pray in my benediction for a safe abode, and a quiet and a joyful
one, and a long abiding to every Mazdayasnian village, and for
a succor even with my wants, for a succor with salutations of
salvation, and for one with praises, O Fire! and for thee, O Ahurian
one of Ahura! do I ask the fullest Yasht.

15. And I pray for (?) Raman Hvastra for this Province, and for
healthfulness and healing. And I pray for it with my blessing
for you pious men, for all. And I pray for him who is saintly
with (true) goodness, whosoever he may be, between heaven and
the earth, for a thousand healing remedies, and for ten thousand
of the same.

16-19. (See Y8.5-8.)

20. Thus may it happen as I pray. 21. And by this may I gain (that)
blessing, the good Blessedness (our sanctity rewarded). And we
address, and we invoke religious zeal and capability, and the
waters with our Yasna thus: O ye good waters! since (they are)
yours, do ye, as you are asked, grant splendor and grant glory,
ye who are well able so to give; and do ye, O ye waters! grant
(once more) that helpful blessing which was gained from you of
old!

22. Praise (be) to Ahura Mazda, and to the Bountiful Immortals.
Praise (be) to Mithra of the wide pastures. Praise to the fleet-horsed
sun. Praise to (the star which so we name, and with this sun)
Ahura Mazda's eyes. Praise to the Kine (the herds of blessed gift).
Praise to Gaya (Maretan) [Gayomard] and to the Fravashi of Zarathushtra (first
of) saints; yea, praise to the entire creation of the holy (and
the clean), to those now living, and to those just passing into
life, and to those of days to come 23. And do Thou then Ahura,
as in answer to these our prayers and songs of praise, cause us
to prosper to salvation through Thy Good Mind, the Sovereign Power,
and Thy Righteous Order (in Thy ritual and law)!

 - CHAPTER 70

<h4>TO THE BOUNTIFUL IMMORTALS, AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF RELIGION.</h4>

1. I would worship these (the Bountiful Immortals) with my sacrifice,
those who rule aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, and this
one (especially) I would approach with my praise, (Ahura Mazda).
He is thus hymned (in our praise-songs). Yea, we worship in our
sacrifice that deity and lord, who is Ahura Mazda, the Creator,
the gracious helper, the maker of all good things; and we worship
in our sacrifice Zarathushtra Spitama, that chieftain (of the
rite).

2. And we would declare those institutions established for us,
exact (and undeviating as they are). And I would declare forth
those of Ahura Mazda, those of the Good Mind, and of Asha Vahishta
(who is Righteousness the Best), and those of Khshatra-vairya
(the Realm to be desired), and those of the Bountiful Aramaiti
(the Piety within us), and those of Weal and Immortality, and
those which appertain to the body of the Kine, and to the Kine's
soul, and those which appertain to Ahura Mazda's Fire, (3) and
those of Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and of Rashnu the most
just, and those of Mithra of the wide pastures, and of (the good
and) holy Wind, and of the good Mazdayasnian Religion, and of
the good and pious Prayer for blessings, and those of the good
and pious Prayer which frees one from belying, and the good and
pious Prayer for blessing against unbelieving words. 4. (And these
we would declare) in order that we may attain unto that speech
which is uttered with (true) religious zeal, or that we may be
as prophets of the provinces, that we may succor him who lifts
his voice (for Mazda), that we may be as prophets who smite with
victory, the befriended of Ahura Mazda, and persons the most useful
to Him, holy men (indeed) who think good thoughts, and speak good
words, and do good deeds. 5. That he may approach us with the
Good Mind, and that (our souls) may advance in good, let it thus
come; yea, 'how may my soul advance in good? let it thus advance.'

6. We praise the flood and ebb of the good waters, and their
roar, and that high Ahura, the royal Apam-napat, the glittering
one, of the fleet horses; and this for the sacrifice, and homage,
and propitiation, and praise of the entire holy creation; and
may Sraosha (Obedience) be here (to aid us).

7. (Yea), we sacrifice to Sraosha, Obedience the blessed.

 - CHAPTER 71

<h4>THE YASNA CONCLUDING.</h4>

1. Frashaoshtra, the holy, asked the saintly Zarathushtra: Answer
me, O thou most eminent Zarathushtra, what is (in very truth)
the memorized recital of the rites?
What is the completed delivery of the Gathas?

2. Upon this Zarathushtra said: (It is as follows.) We worship
Ahura Mazda with our sacrifice (as) the holy lord of the ritual
order; and we sacrifice to Zarathushtra likewise as to a holy
lord of the ritual order; and we sacrifice also to the Fravashi
of Zarathushtra, the saint. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful
Immortals, (the guardians) of the saints. 3. And we sacrifice
to (all) the good heroic and bounteous Fravashis of the saints,
of the bodily (world on earth), and of the mental (those in Heaven).
And we worship that one of ritual lords who attains the most his
ends; and we sacrifice to that one of the Yazads, lords of the
ritual order, who is the most strenuous, who gains the most, who
reaches most to what he seeks, even that well-timed Prayer which
is the prayer of that holy ritual lord, and which has approached
the nearest (to us for our help).

4. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order,
and we worship His entire body, and we worship the Bountiful Immortals
all; and we worship all the ritual lords. And we sacrifice to
the entire Mazdayasnian Faith. And we worship all the sacred metres.

5. And we worship the entire bounteous Mathra, even the entire
system of the Faith set up against the Daevas; and we worship
its complete and long descent. And we sacrifice to all the holy
Yazads, heavenly and earthly; and we worship all the good, heroic,
and bountiful Fravashis of the saints.

6. And we worship all the holy creatures which Mazda created,
and which possess the holy institutions, which were established
holy in their nature, which possess the holy lore, and the holy
sacrifice, which are holy, and for the holy, and to be worshipped
by the holy. And we worship all the five Gathas, the holy ones,
and the entire Yasna [its flow and its ebb, and the sounding (of
its chants)].

7. And we sacrifice to all the Praises of the Yasna,
and to all the words which Mazda spake, which are the most fatal
to evil thoughts, and words, and deeds;

(8) and which designate
the evil thought, and word, and deed, and which then cut down
and fell every evil thought, and word, and deed. [(Pazand.) One
would think of it as when the fire cuts, sucks out, and consumes
the dry wood which has been sanctified and carefully selected
(for its flame).] And we sacrifice to the strength, the victory,
the glory, and the speed of all these words (as they go forth
for their work).

9. And we sacrifice to all the springs of water,
and to the water-streams as well, and to growing plants, and forest-trees,
and to the entire land and heaven, and to all the stars, and to
the moon and sun, even to all the lights without beginning (to
their course). And we sacrifice to all cattle, and to the aquatic
beasts, and to the beasts that live on land, and to all that strike
the wing, and to the beasts that roam the plains, and to those
of cloven hoof.

10. And to all Thy good and holy female (creatures)
in the creation do we sacrifice, (O Thou who art) Ahura Mazda
the skillful maker! on account of which Thou hast made many things
and good things (in Thy world). And we sacrifice to those male
creatures in the creation which are Thine and which are meet for
sacrifice because of Asha Vahishta (of Righteousness the Best).
And we sacrifice to all the mountains brilliant with holiness,
and to all the lakes which Mazda created, and to all fires]. And
we sacrifice to all the truthful and correctly spoken words,

(11) even those which have both rewards and Piety within them. Yea,
we worship (you) for protection and shielding, for guarding and
watching; and may ye be to me for preparation.
I call upon the Gathas here, the bountiful holy ones, ruling in
the ritual order; yea, we sacrifice to you, (O ye Gathas!) for
protection and shielding, for guarding and watching. Mine may
ye be as a preparation. For me, for (mine) own soul I call on
(you), and we would worship (you) for protection and for shielding,
for guarding and for watching.

12. And we sacrifice to Weal, the
complete welfare, holy and ruling in its course in the ritual
order; and we sacrifice to Deathlessness (the immortal being of
the good), holy, and ruling in the ritual order. And we sacrifice
to the question of the Lord; and to His lore, the holy chiefs,
and to the heroic Haptanghaiti, the holy lord of the ritual order.

13. (Frasha.) Let the holy Zarathushtra himself seek out a friend
and a protector. And I say to thee (O Zarathushtra!) to make to
thee a friend holy beyond the holy, and truer than the true, for
that is the better thing; for he is evil who is the best to the
evil, and he is holy to whom the holy is a friend, (14) for these
are the best of words, those which Ahura Mazda spoke to Zarathushtra.

And do thou, O Zarathushtra! pronounce these words at the last
ending of (thy) life.

15. For if, O Zarathushtra! thou shalt pronounce
these words at the last ending of (thy) life I, Ahura Mazda, will
keep your soul away from Hell. Yea, so far away shall I hold it
as is the breadth and extension of the earth [(Pazand) and the
earth is as wide as it is long].

16. As thou dost desire, O holy (one)! so shalt thou be, holy
shalt thou-cause (thy) soul to pass over the Chinvat Bridge; holy
shalt thou come into Heaven. Thou shalt intone the Gatha Ushtavaiti,
reciting the salvation hail.

17. We sacrifice to the active man, and to the man of good intent,
for the hindrance of darkness, of wasting of the strength and
life, and of distraction. And we sacrifice to health and healing,
to progress and to growth, for the hindrance of impurity, and
of the diseases of the skin.

18. And we sacrifice to the (Yasna's) ending words, to those which
end the Gathas. And we sacrifice to the bounteous Hymns themselves
which rule in the ritual course, the holy ones.
And we sacrifice to the Praise-songs of the Yasna which were the
products of the world of yore; yea, we sacrifice to all the Staota-Yesnya
hymns. And we sacrifice to (our) own soul and to (our) Fravashi.

19-21. (See Y6.14-16.)

22. I praise, invoke, and I weave my song to the good, heroic,
bountiful Fravashis of the saints, to those of the house, and
of the village, the district and the province, and to those of
the Zarathushtrotemas. 23. And we sacrifice to the Fire, Ahura
Mazda's son, the holy ritual chief.
And we sacrifice to this Baresman haying the Zaothra with it,
and its girdle with it, and spread with sanctity, the holy ritual
chief. And we sacrifice to Apam-napat, and to Nairya-sangha, and
to that Yazad, the wise man's swift Curse.
And we sacrifice to the souls of the dead, [which are the Fravashis
of the saints] 24. And we sacrifice to that lofty Lord who is
Ahura Mazda Himself.

25. And we pray (again) for the Kine (once more) with these gifts
and (ceremonial) actions which are the best.
