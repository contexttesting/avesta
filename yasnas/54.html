. The Airyema-Ishyo

1. Let the Airyaman, the desired friend and peersman, draw near
for grace to the men and to the women who are taught of Zarathushtra,
for the joyful grace of the Good Mind, whereby the conscience
may attain its wished-for recompense. I pray for the sacred reward
of the ritual order which is (likewise so much) to be desired;
and may Ahura Mazda grant it, (or cause it to increase).

2. We sacrifice to the Airyema-ishyo, the powerful, the victoriously
smiting, the opponent of assaulting malice, the greatest of the
sentences of the holy ritual order. And we sacrifice to the bounteous
Gathas that rule supreme in the ritual, the holy (and august).
And we sacrifice to the Praises of the Yasna which were the productions
of the world of old.
