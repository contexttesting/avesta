<h4>THE YASNA CONCLUDING.</h4>

1. Frashaoshtra, the holy, asked the saintly Zarathushtra: Answer
me, O thou most eminent Zarathushtra, what is (in very truth)
the memorized recital of the rites?
What is the completed delivery of the Gathas?

2. Upon this Zarathushtra said: (It is as follows.) We worship
Ahura Mazda with our sacrifice (as) the holy lord of the ritual
order; and we sacrifice to Zarathushtra likewise as to a holy
lord of the ritual order; and we sacrifice also to the Fravashi
of Zarathushtra, the saint. And we sacrifice to the Bountiful
Immortals, (the guardians) of the saints. 3. And we sacrifice
to (all) the good heroic and bounteous Fravashis of the saints,
of the bodily (world on earth), and of the mental (those in Heaven).
And we worship that one of ritual lords who attains the most his
ends; and we sacrifice to that one of the Yazads, lords of the
ritual order, who is the most strenuous, who gains the most, who
reaches most to what he seeks, even that well-timed Prayer which
is the prayer of that holy ritual lord, and which has approached
the nearest (to us for our help).

4. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order,
and we worship His entire body, and we worship the Bountiful Immortals
all; and we worship all the ritual lords. And we sacrifice to
the entire Mazdayasnian Faith. And we worship all the sacred metres.

5. And we worship the entire bounteous Mathra, even the entire
system of the Faith set up against the Daevas; and we worship
its complete and long descent. And we sacrifice to all the holy
Yazads, heavenly and earthly; and we worship all the good, heroic,
and bountiful Fravashis of the saints.

6. And we worship all the holy creatures which Mazda created,
and which possess the holy institutions, which were established
holy in their nature, which possess the holy lore, and the holy
sacrifice, which are holy, and for the holy, and to be worshipped
by the holy. And we worship all the five Gathas, the holy ones,
and the entire Yasna [its flow and its ebb, and the sounding (of
its chants)].

7. And we sacrifice to all the Praises of the Yasna,
and to all the words which Mazda spake, which are the most fatal
to evil thoughts, and words, and deeds;

(8) and which designate
the evil thought, and word, and deed, and which then cut down
and fell every evil thought, and word, and deed. [(Pazand.) One
would think of it as when the fire cuts, sucks out, and consumes
the dry wood which has been sanctified and carefully selected
(for its flame).] And we sacrifice to the strength, the victory,
the glory, and the speed of all these words (as they go forth
for their work).

9. And we sacrifice to all the springs of water,
and to the water-streams as well, and to growing plants, and forest-trees,
and to the entire land and heaven, and to all the stars, and to
the moon and sun, even to all the lights without beginning (to
their course). And we sacrifice to all cattle, and to the aquatic
beasts, and to the beasts that live on land, and to all that strike
the wing, and to the beasts that roam the plains, and to those
of cloven hoof.

10. And to all Thy good and holy female (creatures)
in the creation do we sacrifice, (O Thou who art) Ahura Mazda
the skillful maker! on account of which Thou hast made many things
and good things (in Thy world). And we sacrifice to those male
creatures in the creation which are Thine and which are meet for
sacrifice because of Asha Vahishta (of Righteousness the Best).
And we sacrifice to all the mountains brilliant with holiness,
and to all the lakes which Mazda created, and to all fires]. And
we sacrifice to all the truthful and correctly spoken words,

(11) even those which have both rewards and Piety within them. Yea,
we worship (you) for protection and shielding, for guarding and
watching; and may ye be to me for preparation.
I call upon the Gathas here, the bountiful holy ones, ruling in
the ritual order; yea, we sacrifice to you, (O ye Gathas!) for
protection and shielding, for guarding and watching. Mine may
ye be as a preparation. For me, for (mine) own soul I call on
(you), and we would worship (you) for protection and for shielding,
for guarding and for watching.

12. And we sacrifice to Weal, the
complete welfare, holy and ruling in its course in the ritual
order; and we sacrifice to Deathlessness (the immortal being of
the good), holy, and ruling in the ritual order. And we sacrifice
to the question of the Lord; and to His lore, the holy chiefs,
and to the heroic Haptanghaiti, the holy lord of the ritual order.

13. (Frasha.) Let the holy Zarathushtra himself seek out a friend
and a protector. And I say to thee (O Zarathushtra!) to make to
thee a friend holy beyond the holy, and truer than the true, for
that is the better thing; for he is evil who is the best to the
evil, and he is holy to whom the holy is a friend, (14) for these
are the best of words, those which Ahura Mazda spoke to Zarathushtra.

And do thou, O Zarathushtra! pronounce these words at the last
ending of (thy) life.

15. For if, O Zarathushtra! thou shalt pronounce
these words at the last ending of (thy) life I, Ahura Mazda, will
keep your soul away from Hell. Yea, so far away shall I hold it
as is the breadth and extension of the earth [(Pazand) and the
earth is as wide as it is long].

16. As thou dost desire, O holy (one)! so shalt thou be, holy
shalt thou-cause (thy) soul to pass over the Chinvat Bridge; holy
shalt thou come into Heaven. Thou shalt intone the Gatha Ushtavaiti,
reciting the salvation hail.

17. We sacrifice to the active man, and to the man of good intent,
for the hindrance of darkness, of wasting of the strength and
life, and of distraction. And we sacrifice to health and healing,
to progress and to growth, for the hindrance of impurity, and
of the diseases of the skin.

18. And we sacrifice to the (Yasna's) ending words, to those which
end the Gathas. And we sacrifice to the bounteous Hymns themselves
which rule in the ritual course, the holy ones.
And we sacrifice to the Praise-songs of the Yasna which were the
products of the world of yore; yea, we sacrifice to all the Staota-Yesnya
hymns. And we sacrifice to (our) own soul and to (our) Fravashi.

19-21. (See Y6.14-16.)

22. I praise, invoke, and I weave my song to the good, heroic,
bountiful Fravashis of the saints, to those of the house, and
of the village, the district and the province, and to those of
the Zarathushtrotemas. 23. And we sacrifice to the Fire, Ahura
Mazda's son, the holy ritual chief.
And we sacrifice to this Baresman haying the Zaothra with it,
and its girdle with it, and spread with sanctity, the holy ritual
chief. And we sacrifice to Apam-napat, and to Nairya-sangha, and
to that Yazad, the wise man's swift Curse.
And we sacrifice to the souls of the dead, [which are the Fravashis
of the saints] 24. And we sacrifice to that lofty Lord who is
Ahura Mazda Himself.

25. And we pray (again) for the Kine (once more) with these gifts
and (ceremonial) actions which are the best.

26-28. (See Y8.5-7.)
