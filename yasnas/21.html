+ NOTE: CATECHETICAL ZAND, OR COMMENTARY UPON THE YENHE HATAM.


(The Yenhe. (To that one) of beings do we offer, whose superior
(fidelity) in the sacrifice Ahura Mazda recognizes by reason of
the sanctity (within him; yea, even to those female saints also
do we sacrifice) whose (superior fidelity is thus likewise known;
thus) we sacrifice to (all, to both) the males and females (of
the saints)!)

1. A word for the Yasna by Zarathushtra, the saint, Yenhe, &c.
Here the worshipper indicates and offers the Yasna (which is the
sacrificial worship) of Mazda as by the command (or as the institution)
of Ahura. Hatam. Here the worshipper offers the sacrificial worship
as if with the beings who are among those who are destined to
live. 2. Yaungham. Here he indicates and offers the sacrificial
worship of those holy females who have Aramaiti at their head,
as homage to the Immortals. These are the three sentences which
comprehend all the Yasnian speech. (Question.) To whom is this
Yasna addressed? (Answer.) To the Bountiful Immortals (in the
course of the Yasna). 3. Thereupon spake Mazda: Salvation to this
one, whosoever he may be! May the absolute ruler Ahura grant it.
(Question.) 4. Whom did He answer with this answer? (Answer.)
He answered: The state of salvation; and with this answer, 'the
state of salvation,' he answered every saint who exists, every
one who is coming into existence, and every one who shall exist
in the future. (Question. Who answered thus? Answer.) The best
One. (Question. What did He answer?) (Answer.) The best thing.
(That is,) the best One, Mazda, answered the best and the holy
(answer) for the better and the holy man. 5. We sacrifice to this
piece, the Yenhe hatam, the prominent and holy Yasht.
