1. With outspread hands in petition for that help, O Mazda, I
will pray for the works of the holy spirit, O thou the Right,
whereby I may please the will of Good Thought and the Ox-Soul.

2. I who would serve you, O Mazda Ahura and Vohu Mano, do ye
give through Asha the blessings of both worlds, the bodily and
that of the Spirit, which set the faithful in felicity.

3. I who would praise ye as never before, Right and Good Thought
and Mazda Ahura, and those for whom Piety makes an imperishable
Dominion to grow; come ye to me help at my call.

4. I who have set my heart on watching over the soul, in union
with Good Thought, and as knowing the rewards of Mazda Ahura for
our works, will, while I have power and strength, teach men to
seek after Right.

5. O Asha, shall I see thee and Good Thought, as one that knows?
(Shall I see) the throne of the mightiest Ahura and the following
of Mazda? Through this word (of promise) on our tongue will we
turn the robber horde unto the Greatest.

6. Come thou with Good Thought, give through Asha, O Mazda, as
the gift to Zarathushtra, according to thy sure words, long enduring
mighty help, and to us, O Ahura, whereby we may overcome the enmity
of our foes.

7. Grant, O thou Asha, the reward, the blessing of Good Thought;
O Piety, give our desire to Vishtaspa and to me; O thou Mazda
and King, grant that your Prophet may command a hearing.

8. The best I ask of Thee, O Best, Ahura (Lord) of one will with
the Best Asha, desiring (it) for the hero Frashaostra and for
those (others) to whom thou wilt give (it), (the best gift) of
Good Mind through all time.

9. With these bounties, O Ahura, may we never provoke your wrath,
O Mazda and Right and Best Thought, we who have been eager in
bringing you songs of praise. Ye are they that are the mightiest
to advance desire and the Dominion of Blessings.

10. The wise whom thou knowest as worthy, for their right (doing)
and their good thought, for them do thou fulfill their longing
for attainment. For I know words of prayer are effective with
Ye, which tend to a good object.

11. I would thereby preserve Right and Good Thought for evermore,
that I may instruct, do thou teach me, O Mazda Ahura, from thy
spirit by thy mouth how it will be with the First Life.
