+ NOTE: DEDICATIONS.


1. I will come to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! as a praiser
and a priest, and an invoker and sacrificer, as a memorizing reciter
and a chanter, for Your sacrifice and homage, which are to be
offered to You, the Bountiful Immortals, and for our dedication
and sanctification; (yea, for ours) who are the holy prophets
(destined to benefit the saints).

2. And to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! would I dedicate the
flesh of my very body, and all the blessings of a prospered life.

3. In this Zaothra with this Baresman, I desire to approach the
holy Yazads with my praise, and all the holy lords of the ritual
order at their times, Havani at his time, and Savanghi and Visya
at their times. 4. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian, and of Zarathushtra's
order.

5. The Zaotar speaks: As an Ahu (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar
(?) speaks forth to me (?).
The Ratu speaks: As an Ahu (revered and) to be chosen, the Zaotar
speaks forth to me.
The Zaotar: So let the Ratu from his Righteousness, holy and learned,
speak forth!
