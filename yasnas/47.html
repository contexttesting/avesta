1. For his holy Spirit and for Best Thought, deed, and word,
in accordance with Right Mazda Ahura with Dominion and Piety shall
give us Welfare and Immortality.

2. The best (work) of this most holy Spirit he fulfills with
the tongue through words of Good Thought, with work of his hands
through the action of Piety, by virtue of this knowledge: he,
even Mazda, is the Father of Right.

3. Thou art the holy Father of this Spirit, which has created
for us the luck-bringing cattle, and for its pasture to give it
peace (has created) Piety, when he had taken counsel, O Mazda,
with Good Thought.

4. From this Spirit have Liars fallen away, O Mazda, but not
the Righteous. Whether one is lord of little or of much, he is
to show love to the righteous, but be ill unto the Liar.

5. And all the best things which by this Holy Spirit thou hast
promised to the righteous, O Mazda Ahura, shall the Liar partake
of them without thy will, who by his actions is on the side of
Ill Thought?

6. Through this holy Spirit, Mazda Ahura, and through the Fire
thou wilt give the division of good to the two parties, with support
of Piety and Right. This verily will convert many who are ready
to hear.
