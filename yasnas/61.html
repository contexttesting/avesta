1. Let us peal forth the Ahuna-vairya in our liturgy between
the heaven and earth, and let us send forth the Asha Vahishta
in our prayer the same, and the Yenhe hatam. And let us send forth
in our liturgies between the heaven and earth the pious and good
prayer of the pious man for blessings, (2) for the encounter with,
and for the displacement of Angra Mainyu with his creatures which
are likewise evil as he is, for he is filled with death (for those
whom he has made). Aye, let us send that petition forth for the
encounter with, and for the dislodgment of the Kahvaredhas and
of the individual Kahvaredha the male, and the female (to the
last individual of each), (3) and for the encounter with, and
the dislodgment of the Kayadhas, and of the individual Kayadhians,
male and female, and of the thieves and robbers, of the Zandas,
and the sorcerers, of the covenant breakers, and of those who
tamper with the covenants. 4. Yea, we send it forth for the encounter
with, and for the overthrow of the murderers of the saints, and
of those who hate and torment us for our Faith, and of those who
persecute the ritual, and the tyrant full of death. Yea, let us
peal them forth for the encounter with and the overthrow of the
wicked, O Zarathushtra Spitama! whoever they may be, whose thoughts,
and words, and works are not congenial to the holy ritual laws.

5. And how shall we drive the Demon of the Lie from hence from
us? Aye, how shall we, the prophets who are yet to serve and save
(thy people), drive the Druj from hence, so that we, having power
over her as being utterly without power, may drive her hence with
blow from the seven Karshvars, for the encounter with, and for
the dislodgment of the entire evil world?
