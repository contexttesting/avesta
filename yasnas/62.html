<h4>TO THE FIRE.</h4>

1. I offer my sacrifice and homage to thee, the Fire, as a good
offering, and an offering with our hail of salvation, even as
an offering of praise with benedictions, to thee, the Fire, O
Ahura Mazda's son! Meet for sacrifice art thou, and worthy of
(our) homage. And as meet for sacrifice, and thus worthy of our
homage, may'st thou be in the houses of men (who worship Mazda).
Salvation be to this man who worships thee in verity and truth,
with wood in hand, and Baresman ready, with flesh in hand, and
holding too the mortar. 2. And may'st thou be (ever) fed with
wood as the prescription orders. Yea, may'st thou have thy perfume
justly, and thy sacred butter without fail, and thine andirons
regularly placed. Be of full-age as to thy nourishment, of the
canon's age as to the measure of thy food, O Fire, Ahura-Mazda's
son! 3. Be now aflame within this house; be ever without fail
in flame; be all ashine within this house; be on thy growth within
this house; for long time be thou thus to the furtherance of the
heroic (renovation), to the completion of (all) progress, yea,
even till the good heroic (millennial) time when that renovation
shall have become complete. 4. Give me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's
son! a speedy glory, speedy nourishment, and speedy booty, and
abundant glory, abundant nourishment, abundant booty, an expanded
mind, and nimbleness of tongue for soul and understanding, even
an understanding continually growing in its largeness, and that
never wanders, and long enduring virile power, (5) an offspring
sure of foot, that never sleeps on watch [not for a third part
of the day, or night], and that rises quick from bed, and likewise
a wakeful offspring, helpful to nurture, or reclaim, legitimate,
keeping order in men's meetings, (yea,) drawing men to assemblies
through their influence and word, grown to power, skillful, redeeming
others from oppression, served by many followers, which may advance
my line (in prosperity and fame), and (my) Vis, and my Zantu,
and (my) province, (yea, an offspring) which may deliver orders
to the Province as (firm and righteous rulers). 6. And may'st
thou grant me, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's Son! that whereby instructors
may be (given) me, now and for evermore, (giving light to me of
Heaven) the best life of the saints, brilliant, all glorious.
And may I have experience of the good reward, and the good renown,
and of the long forecasting preparation of the soul. 7. The Fire
of Ahura Mazda addresses this admonition to all for whom he cooks
the night and morning (meal). From all these, O Spitama! he wishes
to secure good care, and healthful care (as guarding for salvation),
the care of a true praiser. 8. At both the hands of all who come
by me, I, the Fire, keenly look: What brings the mate to his mate
(thus I say to him), the one who walks at large, to him who sits
at home? [We worship the bounteous Fire, the swift-driving charioteer.]

9. And if this man who passes brings him wood brought (with good
measure that is) with sacred care, or if he brings the Baresman
spread with sanctity, or the Hadhanaepata plant, then afterwards
Ahura Mazda's Fire will bless him, contented, not offended, and
in (its) satisfaction (saying thus). 10. May a herd of kine be
with thee, and a multitude of men, may an active mind go with
thee, and an active soul as well. As a blest soul may'st thou
live through thy life, the nights which thou shall live. This
is the blessing of the Fire for him who brings it wood (well)
dried, sought out for flaming, purified with the earnest blessing
of the sacred ritual truth. 11. We strive after the flowing on
of the good waters, and their ebb as well, and the sounding of
their waves, desiring their propitiation; I desire to approach
them with my praise.

12. (= Y3.24-25).
