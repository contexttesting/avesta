<h4>TO THE EARTH AND THE SACRED WATERS.</h4>

1. And now we worship this earth which bears us, together with
Thy wives, O Ahura Mazda! yea, those Thy wives do we worship which
are so desired from their sanctity. 2. We sacrifice to their zealous
wishes, and their capabilities, their inquiries (as to duty),
and their wise acts of pious reverence, and with these their blessedness,
their full vigor and good portions, their good fame and ample
wealth. 3. O ye waters! now we worship you, you that are showered
down, and you that stand in pools and vats, and you that bear
forth. (our loaded vessels?) ye female Ahuras of Ahura, you that
serve us (all) in helpful ways, well forded and full-flowing,
and effective for the bathings, we will seek you and for both
the worlds! 4. Therefore did Ahura Mazda give you names, O ye
beneficent ones! when He who made the good bestowed you. And by
these names we worship you, and by them we would ingratiate ourselves
with you, and with them would we bow before you, and direct our
prayers to you with free confessions of our debt. O waters, ye
who are productive, and ye maternal ones, ye with heat that suckles
the (frail and) needy (before birth), ye waters (that have once
been) rulers of (us) all, we will now address you as the best,
and the most beautiful; those (are) yours, those good (objects)
of our offerings, ye long of arm to reach our sickness, or misfortune,
ye mothers of our life!
