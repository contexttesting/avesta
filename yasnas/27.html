+ NOTE: PRELUDE TO THE CHIEF RECITAL OF THE AHUNA-VAIRYA.

1. This is to render Him who is of all the greatest, our lord
and master (even) Ahura Mazda. And this to smite the wicked Angra
Mainyu, and to smite Aeshma of the bloody spear, and the Mazainya
Daevas, and to smite all the wicked Varenya Daevas.

2. And this is to further Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the glorious,
to further the Bountiful Immortals, and the influences of the
star Tishtrya, the resplendent, the glorious, (and) to the furtherance
of the holy man, and of all the (bountiful and) holy creatures
of the Bounteous Spirit.

3-5.
(The Ahunwar appears here with Y34.5, the Airyema Ishyo, and
the Ashem Vohu.)

6. The Haomas are crushed, O Mazda, Khshathra, and Asha, O ye
Lords! Good is Sraosha who accompanies the sacrifice with the
great glory, and may he be present affording strenuous help.

7. We are offering saving acts of wisdom and of worship with
the sacred gift of the Ahuna-Vairya intoned with sanctity, and
of the two mortars here brought forward with holy act, and with
that of the correctly uttered words likewise; and therefore may
they be to us the more saving in their wise significance.

8-12.
(See Y33.11-14; and Y1.23, and Y12.)

13. As the Ahu is excellent, so is the Ratu (one who rules) from
(his) sanctity, a creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions
done for Mazda; and the Kingdom (is) for Ahura, which to the poor
may offer a nurturer. 14. (What is Your Kingdom, Your riches;
how may I be Your own in my actions, to nourish Your poor, O Mazda?
Beyond; yea, beyond all we declare You, far from Daevas and Khrafstra-accursed
mortals!)

15. We worship the Ahuna-vairya. We worship Asha Vahishta, the
most beautiful, the Bountiful Immortal.
