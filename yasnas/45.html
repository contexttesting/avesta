1. I will speak forth: hear now and hearken now, ye from near
and ye from far that desire (instruction). Now observe this in
your mind, all of you, for he is revealed. Never shall the false
Teacher destroy the Second Life, the Liar, in perversion by his
tongue into evil belief.

2. I will speak of the Spirits twain at the first beginning of
the world, of whom the holier spoke thus to the enemy: "Neither
thought, nor teachings, nor wills, nor beliefs, nor words, nor
deeds, nor selfs, nor souls of us twain agree".

3. I will speak of that which Mazda Ahura, the all-knowing, revealed
to me first in this (earthly) life. Those of you that put not
in practice this word as I think and utter it, to them shall be
woe at the end of life.

4. I will speak of what is best for the life. Through Asha I
have come to know, O Mazda, who created it (the life), the father
of active Good Thought: but his daughter is the good-working Armaiti.
The all-observant Ahura is not to be deceived.

5. I will speak of that which (he), the Holiest declared to me
as the word that is best for mortals to obey; while he said: "they
who for my sake render him obedience, shall all attain unto Welfare
and Immortality by the actions of the Good Spirit [Spenta Mainyu -JHP]" - (he)
Mazda Ahura.

6. I will speak of him who is the greatest of all, praising him,
O Right, who is bounteous to all that live. By the holy spirit
let Mazda Ahura hearken, in whose Adoration I have been instructed
by Good Thought. By his wisdom let him teach me what is best,

7. Even he whose two awards, whereof he ordains, men shall attain,
who so are living or have been or shall be. In immortality shall
the soul of the righteous be joyful, in perpetuity shall be the
torment of Liars. All this doth Mazda Ahura appoint by his Dominion.

8. Him thou shouldst seek to win for us by hymns of adoration
(in thy mind): "Now indeed have I seen it with mine eye,
(the Kingdom) of the good spirit [Spenta Mainyu -JHP] and of (good) action and word,
since I have learnt to know Mazda Ahura through Right". Let
us offer him homage in the House of Song [Heaven].

9. Him thou shouldst seek to propitiate for us together with
Good Thought, who at his will maketh us weal or woe. May Mazda
Ahura by his Dominion bring us to work, for prospering our beasts
and our men, so that we may through Right have familiarity with
Good Thought.

10. Him thou shouldst seek to exalt with prayers of piety, him
that is called Mazda Ahura for ever, for that he hath promised
through his own Right and Good Thought that Welfare and Immortality
shall be for us in his Dominion strength and perpetuity in his
house.

11. Whoso therefore in the future lightly esteemeth the Daeva
and those mortals that lightly esteem him - even all others save
that one who highly esteemeth him, - unto his shall the holy Daena
of the future deliverer, as lord of the house, be friend, brother
or father, O Mazda Ahura.
