+ NOTE:  INVOCATIONS AND DEDICATIONS.
  Y13.1-6 and the beginning of 7 is in the Old Avesta dialect.


1. I address (my invocation to) Ahura Mazda. And I invoke (among
guardian beings) the chief of the house-lord, and the chief of
the Vis-lord, and the chief of the Zantu-lord. And I invoke the
chief of the province-lord. And the chief of women I invoke, the
Mazdayasnian Faith, the blessed and good Parendi, her who is the
holy one of human-kind. And I invoke this (holy) earth which bears
us.

2. And I invoke the friendly and most helpful person's lord,
the Fire of Ahura Mazda, and also the most energetic lords of
holy men, those who are most strenuous in their care of cattle
and the fields, and the chief of the thrifty tiller of the earth.
And I invoke the steady settler of sanctity, (and) the chief of
the charioteer.

3. And I invoke the chief of the fire-priest by means of the
most imposing sciences of the Mazdayasnian Faith. And I invoke
the chief of the Atharvan, and his pupils I invoke; yea, the lords
of each of them. I invoke these lords, and I summon the Bountiful
Immortals here, and the Prophets who shall serve us, the wisest
as they are, the most scrupulous in their exactness (as) they
utter words (of doctrine and of service), the most devoted (to
their duties likewise), and the most glorious in their thoughts(?).
And I invoke the most imposing forces of the Mazdayasnian Faith,
and the fire-priests I invoke, and the charioteers, the warriors,
and the thrifty tillers of the soil.

4. And to You, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! Ye who rule aright,
and dispose (of all) aright, I offer the flesh of my very frame,
and all the blessings of my life.

Thus the two spirits thought, thus they spoke, and thus they did;

5. And therefore as Thou, O Ahura Mazda! didst think, speak,
dispose, and do all things good (for us), so to Thee would we
give, so would we assign to Thee our homage; so would we worship
Thee with our sacrifices. So would we bow before Thee with these
gifts, and so direct our prayers to Thee with confessions of our
debt.

6. By the kinship of the good kindred, by that of Righteousness
the good (Thy righteous servant's nature) would we approach Thee,
and by that of the good thrift-law, and of Piety the good.

7. And we would worship the Fravashi of the Kine of blessed gift,
and that of the holy Gaya Mareyan [Gayomard], and we would worship the holy
Fravashi of Zarathushtra Spitama, the saint. Yea, that one of
beings do we worship whose better (service) in the sacrifice Ahura
Mazda knows; (even those women do we worship) whose (better service
thus is known). Yea, both (holy) men and women (do we worship
whom Ahura Mazda knows).
As the Ahu is excelling....
A blessing is the Right called the best....

8. We worship the Ahuna-vairya; and we worship Asha Vahishta
the best(?), the bountiful Immortal. And we sacrifice to the Ha
fraoreti, even to the confession and laudation of the Mazdayasnian
Faith!
