1. Ever has Bendva been for me the greatest obstacle, I who desire
to give satisfaction to those who are neglected, O Right, O Mazda.
With good Ada come to me, support me firmly. Prepare for him (his)
ruin, O Good Thought.

2. The perverter of this Bendva has long time impeded me, the
Liar who has fallen away from Right. He cares not that holy Piety
should be his, nor takes the counsel with Good Thought, O Mazda.

3. And in this belief (of ours), O Mazda, Right is laid down,
for blessing, in the heresy the Lie, for ruin. Therefore I strive
for the fellowship of Good Thought, I forbid all intercourse with
the Liar.

4. They who make the increase of violence and cruelty with their
tongues, the foes of cattle-nurture among its friends; whose ill
deeds prevail, not their good deeds: these (shall be) in the house
of the Daevas, (the place for) the Self of the Liar.

5. But he, O Mazda, - happiness and satiety be his who links
his own Self with Good Thought, being through Right an intimate
of Piety. And with all these (may I be) in Thy Dominion, Ahura.

6. I beseech you twain, O Mazda and the Right, to say what are
the plans of your will, that we may discern how we might teach
the Religion of such as you, O Ahura.

7. And this let Good Thought hear, O Mazda, let the Right hear,
do thou also listen, O Ahura, which men of the brotherhood, what
noble is it according to the Law who brings to the community fame.

8. On Frashaoshtra do thou bestow the most gladsome fellowship
with the Right - this I ask thee, O Mazda Ahura - and on myself
the hold on what is good in thy Dominion. To all eternity we would
be thy messengers.

9. Let the helper hear the ordinance, he that is created to bring
deliverance. The man of right words is no regarder of fellowship
with the Liar, if they that are partakers of Right are to make
their Selves partake in the best reward at the Judgment, O Jamaspa.

10. And this, O Mazda, will I put in thy care within thy House
- the Good Thought and the souls of the Righteous, their worship,
their Piety and zeal, that thou mayst guard it, O thou mighty
Dominion, with abiding power.

11. But these that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil
words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars, the Souls go to meet
them with evil food; in the House of the Lie they shall be meet
inhabitants.

12. What help hast thou, O Right, for Zarathushtra that calls
upon me? What hast thou, Good Thought? â€” for me who with praises
seeks your favor, O Mazda Ahura, longing for that which is best
in your possession.
