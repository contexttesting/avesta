<h4>THE WORSHIP OF THE GATHAS AS CONCLUDED, THAT OF THE STAOTA
YESNYA AS BEGINNING.</h4>

1. We present hereby and we make known, as our offering to the
bountiful Gathas which rule (as the leading chants) within (the
appointed times and seasons of) the Ritual, all our landed riches,
and our persons, together with our very bones and tissues, our
forms and forces, our consciousness, our soul, and Fravashi.

2. That which Gathas (may) be to us, which are our guardians
and defenders, and our spiritual food, yea, which (may) be to
our souls both food and clothing, such are these Gathas to us,
guardians, and defenders, and (spiritual) food, even such they
are, both food and clothing to the soul.
And (may) they be to us (for this our offering) abundant givers
of rewards, and just and righteous ones, for the world beyond
the present, after the parting of our consciousness and body.
3. And may these (Praises of the Offering) come forth, and appear
for us with power and victorious assault, with health and healing,
with progress, and with growth, with preparation and protection,
with beneficence and sanctity, and abounding with gifts toward
him who can understand; yea, let them appear (with free liberality
to the enlightened), let them appear as Mazda, the most beneficent,
has produced them, He the one who is victorious when He smites,
and who helps the settlements advance, for the protection, and
the guarding of the religious order of the settlements which are
now being furthered, and of those which shall bring salvation
to us, and for the protection of the entire creation of the holy
(and the clean).

4. And may'st thou, (O Asha! who abidest within the Gathas),
give to every holy man who comes with this prayer for a blessing,
and endeavoring to help himself, according to his good thoughts,
and words, and deeds.

5. We are therefore worshipping both the (divine) Righteousness
and the Good Mind, and the bountiful Gathas, that rule as the
leading chants within (the times and the seasons of) the holy
ritual order.

6. And we worship the Praises of the Yasna which were the production
of the ancient world, those which are (now) recollected and put
in use, those which are now learned and taught, those which are
being held (in mind, and so) repeated, those remembered and recited,
and those worshipped, and thus the ones which further the world
through grace in its advance.
And we worship the part(s) of the Praises of the Yasna, and their
recitation as it is heard, even their memorized recital, and their
chanting, and their offering (as complete).
