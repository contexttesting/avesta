1. To each several man, to whom Mazda Ahura ruling at his will
grant after the (petitioner's) will, I will after his will that
he attain permanence and power, lay hold of Right - grant this,
O Piety, - the destined gift of wealth, the life of the Good Thought,

2. and it shall be for him the best of all things. After his
longing for bliss may one be given bliss, through the provident
most holy spirit, O Mazda, even the blessings of Good Thought
which thou wilt give through Right all the days with joy of enduring
life.

3. May he attain to that which is better than the good, who would
teach us the straight paths of blessedness in this life here of
the body and in that of thought - true paths that lead to the
world where Ahura Mazda dwells - a faithful man, well-knowing
and holy like thee, O Mazda.

4. Then shall I recognize thee as strong and holy, O Mazda, when
by the hand in which thou thyself dost hold the destinies that
thou wilt assign to the Liar and the Righteous, by the glow of
thy Fire whose power is Right, the might of Good Thought shall
come to me.

5. As the holy one [spenta] I recognize thee, Mazda Ahura, when I saw
thee in the beginning at the birth of Life, when thou madest actions
and words to have their meed — evil for the evil, a good destiny
for the good — through thy wisdom when creation shall reach its
goal.

6. At which goal thou wilt come with thy holy Spirit, O Mazda,
with Dominion, at the same with Good Thought, by whose action
the settlements will prosper through Right. Their judgments shall
Piety proclaim, even those of thy wisdom which none can deceive.

7. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me and asked me: "Who art thou? to whom dost
thou belong? By what signs wilt thou appoint the days for questioning
about thy possessions and thyself?"

8. Then I said to him: "To the first (question), Zarathushtra
am I, a true foe to the Liar, to the utmost of my power, but a
powerful support would I be to the Righteous, that I may attain
the future things of the infinite Dominion, according as I praise
and sing thee, O Mazda.

9. As the holy one I recognize thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good Thought
came to me. To his question, "For which wilt thou decide"
(I made reply). "At the gift of adoration to thy Fire, I
will bethink me of Right so long as I have power.

10. Then show me Right, upon whom I call.
(Mazda:) "Associating him with Piety, I have come hither.
Ask us now what things are here for thee to ask. For thy asking
is as that of a mighty one, since he that is able should make
thee as a mighty one possessed of thy desire."

11. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me, when first by your words I was instructed.
Shall it bring me sorrow among men, my devotion, in doing that
which ye tell me is the best.

12. And when thou saidest to me, 'To Right shalt thou go for teaching',
then thou didst not command what I did not obey: 'Speed thee,
ere my Obedience come, followed by treasure-laden Destiny, who
shall render to men severally the destiny of the two-fold award.'

13. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me to learn the state of my desire. Grant it me,
that which none may compel you to allow, (the wish) for long continuance
of blessed existence that they say is in thy Dominion.

14. If thy provident side, such as an understanding man who has
the power would give to his friends, comes to me by the Dominion
through Right, then I will bestir myself to set myself in opposition
against the foes of thy Law, together with all those who are mindful
of thy words.

15. As the holy one I recognized thee, Mazda Ahura, when Good
Thought came to me, when the best Tushna-Matay taught me to declare:
"Let not men seek again and again to please the Liars, for
they make all the righteous enemies."

16. And Zarathushtra himself, O Ahura, chooses each one of thy
holiest Spirit, O Mazda. May Right be embodied full of life and
strength! May Piety abide in the Dominion bright as the sun! May
Good Thought give destiny to men according to their works!
