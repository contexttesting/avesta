  + NOTE:  Translation by Bartholomae, from I.J.S. Taraporewala, <i>The
  Divine Songs of Zarathushtra</i>.


1. (Zarathushtra) - The best possession known is of Zarathushtra
Spitama, which is that Mazda Ahura will give him through Right
the glories of blessed life unto all time, and likewise to them
that practice and learn the words and actions of his Good Religion.

2. Then let them seek the pleasure of Mazda with thoughts, words,
and actions, unto him praise gladly, and seek his worship, even
Kava Vishtaspa, and Zarathushtra's son, the Spitamid, with Frashaoshtra,
making straight the paths for the Religion of the future Deliverer
which Ahura ordained.

3. Him, O Pouruchista, thou scion of Haechataspa and Spitama,
youngest of Zarathushtra's daughters, hath (Zarathushtra) appointed
as one to enjoin on them the fellowship with Good Thought, Right,
and Mazda. So take counsel with thine own understanding, with
good insight practice the holiest works of Piety.

4. (Jamaspa): Earnestly will I lead her to the Faith, that she
may serve her father and her husband, the farmers and the nobles,
as a righteous woman (serving) the righteous. The glorious heritage
of Good Thought ... shall Mazda Ahura give to her for all time.

5. (Zarathushtra): Teachings address I to maidens marrying, and
to you (bridegrooms) giving counsel. Lay them to heart and learn
to get them within your Selves in earnest attention to the Life
of Good Thought. Let each of you strive to excel the other in
the Right, for it will be a prize for that one.

6. So is it in fact, ye men and women! Whatever happiness ye
look for in the follower of the (...) that will be snatched away
from his person. To them the Liars, crying 'woe', shall be ill-food,
paradise shall be lost to them that despite righteousness. In
such wise ye destroy for yourselves the Spiritual Life.

7. And to you shall accrue the reward of the Brotherhood - in
so far as the most faithful zeal is in your flesh and blood -
there where the spirit of the Liar, cringing and cowering, shall
fall down into destruction. If you separate yourselves from the
Brotherhood, then will 'woe!' be your word at the end of things.

8. So they whose deeds are evil, let them be deceived, and let
them all howl, abandoned to ruin. Through good rulers let him
bring death and bloodshed upon them and peace from these (their
assaults) unto the happy villagers. Grief let him bring on those,
he that is the greatest, with the lord of death; and soon let
it be.

9. To men of evil creed belongs the place of corruption. They
that set themselves to contemn the worthy, despising righteousness,
forfeiting their own body. - Where is the Righteous Lord who shall
rob them of life and freedom? Thine Mazda is the Dominion, whereby
thou canst give to the right-living poor man the better portion.
