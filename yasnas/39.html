<h4>TO THE SOUL OF THE KINE, &C.</h4>

1. And now we sacrifice to the Kine's soul, and to her created
body, and we sacrifice to the souls of cattle who are fit to live
(for us), and whose (we?) are, such as are the same to them.

2. And we worship the souls of those beasts which are tame and
broken in, and of wild herds, and the souls of the saints wherever
they were born, both of men and of women, whose good consciences
are conquering in the strife against the Daevas, or will conquer,
or have conquered.

3. And now we worship the Bountiful Immortals (all) the good,
and both those male, and those female (by their names). The males
among them do we worship, ever living, and ever helpful, who dwell
beside the pious, and the females thus the same. 4. As Thou, O
Ahura Mazda! hast thought and spoken, as thou hast determined,
and hast done these things (effecting) what is good, therefore
do we offer to Thee, therefore do we ascribe to Thee our praises,
and worship Thee, and bow ourselves before Thee; and therefore
would we direct our prayers to Thee, Ahura! with confessions of
our sin.

5. And we thus draw near to Thee together with the good kinship
of our kindred, with that of Righteousness the blessed, and the
good law of thrift and energy and the good Piety, the ready mind
(within Thy folk)!
