1. To what land shall I go to flee, whither to flee? From nobles
and from my peers they sever me, nor are the people pleased with
me [......], nor the Liar rulers of the land. How am I to please
thee, Mazda Ahura?

2. I know wherefore, O Mazda, I have been unable (to achieve)
anything. Only a few herds are mine (and therefore it is so) and
because I have got but few people. I cry unto thee, see thou to
it, O Ahura, granting me support a friend gives to friend. Teach
me through the Right what the acquisition of Good Thought is.

3. When, Mazda, shall the sunrisings come forth for the worlds
winning of Right, through the powerful teachings of the wisdom
of the future Deliverers? Who are they to whose help Good Thought
shall come? I have faith that thou wilt thyself fulfill this for
me, O Ahura.

4. The Liar stays the supporter of Right from prospering the
cattle in district and province, infamous that he is, repellent
in his actions. Whoso, Mazda, robs him of dominion or of life,
he shall go before and prepare the ways of the good belief.

5. If an understanding man should be able to hold one who comes
over from his vow and his ties of faith, himself having brought
him thereto, and living according to the ordinance, a righteous
man (converting) a Liar - then shall he, when he is sure of him,
tell it to the nobles, that they may protect him from injury,
O Mazda Ahura.

6. But whoso when thus approached should refuse his aid, he shall
go to the abodes of the company of the Liar. For he is himself
a Liar, who is very good to a Liar, he is a righteous man to whom
a righteous man is dear, since thou hast created men's Selves
in the beginning, O Ahura.

7. Whom, O Mazda, can one appoint as protector for one like me,
when the Liar sets himself to injure me, other than Thy Fire and
Thy Thought, through actions of which twain the Right will come
to maturity, O Ahura? In this lore do thou instruct my very self.

8. Whoso is minded to injure my possessions, from his actions
may no harm come to me! Back upon himself may they come with hostility,
against his own person, all the hostile (acts), to keep him far
from the Good Life, Mazda, not from the ill!

9. Who is it, the faithful man he, who first taught that we honor
thee as mightiest to help, as the holy righteous Lord over action?
What thy Right made known, what the Ox-Creator made known to Right,
they would fain hear through thy Good Mind.

10. Whoso, man or woman, doeth what thou, Mazda Ahura, knowest
as best in life, as destiny for what is Right (give him) the Dominion
through Good Thought. And those whom I impel to your adoration,
with all these will I cross the Bridge of the Separator.

11. By their dominion the Karapans and the Kavis accustomed mankind
to evil actions, so as to destroy Life. Their own soul and their
own self shall torment them when they come where the Bridge of
the Separator is, to all time dwellers in the House of the Lie.

12. When among the laudable descendants and posterity of the Turanian
Fryana the Right ariseth, through activity of Piety that blesseth
substance; then shall Good Thought admit them, and Mazda Ahura
give them protection at the Fulfillment.

13. Whoso among mortals has pleased Spitama Zarathushtra by his
willingness, a man deserving of good fame, to him shall Mazda
Ahura give Life, to him shall Good Thought increase substance,
him we account to be a familiar friend with your Right.

14. O Zarathushtra, what righteous man is thy friend for the great
covenant? Who wills to have good fame? It is the Kava Vishtaspa
at the consummation. Those whom thou wilt unite in one house with
thee, these will I call with words of Good Thought.

15. Ye Haechataspa Spitamas, I will declare unto ye so that ye
can discern the wise and the unwise. ... Through these actions
ye shall acquire Right according to the primeval laws of Ahura.

16. Frashaoshtra Hvogva, go thou thither with those faithful whom
we both desire to be in blessedness, where with Right is united
Piety, where the Dominion is in possession of Good Thought, where
Mazda Ahura dwells to give it increase.

17. When, O Jamaspa Hvogva, when I recount your wrongs not your
successes, (and) with your obedience the prayers of your loyalty,
(before him) who shall separate the wise and the unwise through
his prudent counselor the Right, even he, Mazda Ahura.

18. He that holds unto me, to him I promise what is best in my
possession through the Good Thought, but enmities to him that
shall set himself to devise enmity to us, O Mazda and the Right,
desiring to satisfy your will. That is the decision of my understanding
and thought.

19. He who accomplisheth for me, even Zarathushtra, in accordance
with Right that which best agrees with my will, to him as earning
the reward of the Other Life shall be that of two pregnant cows,
with all things whereon his mind is set. These things will thou
bring to pass for me who best knowest how, O Mazda.
