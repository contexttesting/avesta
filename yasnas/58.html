<h4>THE FSHUSHO MATHRA.</h4>

1. (Introduction.) (To the increase of our homage and praise
of God) we offer this service which, as our defense, may shield
us, which is worship with its beneficent results; and Blessedness
is with it of a verity, and Piety as well. [ (Pazand) and of this
worship the results here mentioned are the well-thought thought,
the word well spoken, and the deed well done]; and let this our
worship shelter us from the Daeva and from the evil-minded man.
2. And to this worship do we confide our settlements and persons
for protection and care, for guarding, and for oversight; (3)
and in this worship will we abide, O Ahura Mazda! and with joy.

In this worship do we exercise our choices; and to it will we
approach, and to it will we belong; yea, to revering worship will
we confide our settlements and persons for protection, and for
care, for guarding, and for oversight, to such worship as is the
praise of such as You.

<h3>MATHRA.</h3>

4. The owner of herds is the righteous (one), and he is victorious
when he strikes, and thus he is the best; [(Pazand) we therefore
offer (this) service (for herd-owners)] for the herd-owner is
the father of the Kine by the help of him who follows the ritual
order: and he is the father of the holy man as well, and of the
sanctified creation. He is in verity the bestower of blessings,
and to him, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! we render, (and his do we
make) Your greatness, Your goodness, and Your (spiritual) beauty,
and let this man, the cattle-owner, approach to guard over us;
and may he be our watchman together with the Righteous Order,
and with store for our nourishment and full generous liberality,
together with sharing of the goods, with gentleness, and with
Ahura Mazda's sacred Fire!

5. O Ye Bountiful Immortals! as Ye have made us, so do Ye save
us, holy men, and saintly women (as we are, and steadfast in the
faith)l. Save us, O Ye Bountiful Immortals! Ye who rule aright,
and who dispose (of all) aright, for none other do I know, save
You; then with Your Righteousness do Ye save us.

6. And we offer hereby our thoughts, and words, and actions,
our herds, and men, to the Bountiful Spirit. And may the creative
stars of Ahura Mazda, the Creator, shine down on us, and round
about us with full herds and healthy settlements, with healthy
herds and healthy men, and with all in vigor, and endowed with
the blessing of the Lord. 7. Praise to Thee, O Fire of Ahura Mazda
I may'st thou come to (us in) the greatest one of the engrossing
interests for the help of the great (effort), for the joy-producing
grace of the great (interest of our cause); grant us both Weal
and Deathlessness!

8. We sacrifice to the entire collection of the Praises of the
Yasna, with the careful structure of their language which has
reached the most its object. And we offer (our homage) in our
celebrations to Thy body, O Ahura Mazda! the most beautiful of
forms, these stars, and to that one, the highest of the high [(Pazand)
such as the sun was called]. Yea, we worship the Praises of the
Yasna which were the production of the world of old.
