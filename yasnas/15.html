+ NOTE: THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES.


1. With precept, praise, and with delight produced by grace,
I call upon the Bountiful Immortals the good, and also therewith
the beautiful by name; and I sacrifice to them with the blessing
of the good ritual, with the earnest blessings of the good Mazdayasnian
Faith.

2. Whose best gift from his Righteousness is mine in the offering
Ahura this knoweth; who have lived, and live ever, by their names
these I worship, while I draw near with praises. The Good Kingdom
is to be chosen, that lot which most of all bears on (our blessings).

3. Let Sraosha (Obedience) be here present for the sacrifice
of Ahura Mazda, the most beneficent, the holy, who is so dear
to us as at the first, so at the last; yea, let him be present
here.

4. As the Ahu (revered and) to be chosen, the Atarevakhsha thus
speaks forth to me.
(Response): So let the Ratu from his righteousness, holy and learned,
speak forth!
