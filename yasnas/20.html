+ NOTE: ZAND, OR COMMENTARY, ON THE ASHEM VOHU.

1. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the best; there is weal,
there is weal to this man when the Right (helps) the Righteousness
best, (when the pious man serves it in truth). Ahura Mazda spake
forth: Ashem vohu vahishtem asti. To this Asha, the holy ritual
sanctity, one attributes the qualities of 'good' and 'best,' as
one attributes property to an owner; thus this sentence vohu vahishtem
asti is substantiated (at once).

2. Ushta asti ushta ahmai; by this attribution of blessedness
(the praiser) assigns every person (or thing) of a sacred nature
to every holy person, and as one usually (?) and regularly (?)
assigns every person or thing (?) that is holy to every holy man.

3. Hyat ashai vahishtai; by these words the worshipper ascribes
the entire Mathra (to Asha Vahishta), and ascribes all to the
Mathra, as one ascribes the kingdom to Righteousness, and as one
ascribes righteousness to the invoking saint; yea, as one ascribes
righteousness to us who are the prophets (who shall help and bless
the people). The three maxims of the sentences (are thus fulfilled).
And every word (in its detail), and the entire utterance in its
proclamation, is the word of Ahura Mazda.

+ NOTE:<h3>CATECHETICAL ADDITION.</h3>

Of what character is He who has thus announced Him? (Answer.)
He is the best, and the one who is exercising sovereign power.

We sacrifice to the (several) part(s) of the Asha Vahishta (prayer).
We sacrifice to the heard-recital of the Asha Vahishta, to its
memorizing, its chanting, and its sacrificial use!
