<h4>OFFERING OF THE MEAT-OFFERING IN PARTICULAR. THE FAITHFUL PARTAKE.</h4>

1. A blessing is Righteousness (called) the Best.
It is weal; it is weal to this (man),
When toward Righteousness Best there is right.
I offer the Myazda (of the) meat-offering with a complete and
sacred offering; and I offer Haurvatatat (who guards the water),
and Ameretatat (who guards the plants and the wood), and the flesh
of the blessed Kine; and I offer the Haoma and the Haoma-juice,
the wood-billets and the perfume for the praise of Ahura Mazda,
and of the Ahuna-vairya, the veracious word, and for that of the
pious and beneficent Prayer for blessings, and for the redoubted
Curse of the wise, and for the praise of the Haoma, and of the
Mathra of the holy Zarathushtra; and may it come to us with sacred
fullness (to accept and to recompense our gift).

2. (The Ratu speaks.) Eat, O ye men, of this Myazda, the meat-offering,
ye who have deserved it by your righteousness and correctness.

3. O ye Bountiful Immortals, and thou, the Mazdayasnian law,
ye just men and just women, and ye Zaothras, whoever among these
Mazdayasnians would call himself a Mazdayasnian desiring to live
in the practice of the liberality of Righteousness [for by sorcery
the settlements of Righteousness are ruined], do ye cause (such
an one) to be (still further) taught<sup>1</sup>, (ye), who are the waters,
the plants, and the Zaothras!

   + NOTE: 1. Hum2 159 (mazdayasnO aoJanO aCah= rA+ma JIctayamnO):
  "pretending to be a Mazdayasnian (but) *hating (those
  who are) *dependent on truth"


4. And whoever of these Mazdayasnians, adults, when he invokes
with earnestness, does not adhere to these words, and (so) speaks,
he approaches to that (word) of the magician; (but, as against
that magician's word) 'a blessing is Righteousness (called) the
Best.'

5. May'st Thou, O Ahura Mazda! reign at Thy will, and with a
saving rule over Thine own creatures, and render Ye the holy (man)
also a sovereign at his will over waters, and over plants, and
over all the clean and sacred (creatures) which contain the seed
of Righteousness. Strip ye the wicked of all power!<sup>2</sup>

   + NOTE: 2. Hum2 90 (xCayamnem aCavanem dAyata axCayamnem drva#tem):
  "cause You the truthful one to be in control (of himself),
  the deceitful one not to be in control (of himself)"


6. Absolute in power may the holy be, bereft of all free choice
the wicked ! Gone (may he be), met as foe, carried out from the
creatures of Spenta Mainyu, hemmed in without power over any wish!

7. I will incite, even I who am Zarathushtra, the heads of the
houses, villages, Zantus, and provinces, to the careful following
of this Religion which is that of Ahura, and according to Zarathushtra,
in their thoughts, their words, and their deeds.<sup>3</sup>
</td> + NOTE: 3. Hum2 183 (haxCaya ... fratem& ... ai*h@ da%nay@ anumataya%ja
   anuxtaya%ja anuvarctaya%ja): "I would spur on the authorities
   ... to follow this religion with thoughts, word, and actions"


8. I pray for the freedom and glory of the entire existence of
the holy (man) while I bless it, and I pray for the repression
and shame of the entire existence of the wicked.

9. Ashem Vohu ... (3).

Propitiation to Haoma who brings righteousness (to us) for
sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and for praise. (The Zaotar?)
As the Ahu to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar speaks forth
to me. (The Ratu.) As an Ahu to be (revered and) chosen, the Zaotar
speaks forth to me. (The Zaotar.) So let the Ratu from his Righteousness,
holy and learned, speak forth!
