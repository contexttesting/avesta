1. (Zarathushtra) — And his blessedness, even that of Ahura
Mazda, shall the nobles strive to attain, his the community with
the brotherhood, his, ye Daevas, in the manner as I declare it.

(The Representatives of the Classes) — As thy messengers we would
keep them far away that are enemies to you.

2. To them Mazda Ahura, who is united with Good Thought, and
is in goodly fellowship with glorious Right, through Dominion,
made reply: We make choice of your holy good Piety [Armaiti] — may it be
ours.

3. (Zarathushtra) — But ye, ye Daevas all, and he that highly
honors you, are the seed of Bad Thought — yes, and of the Lie
and of Arrogance, likewise your deeds, whereby ye have long been
known in the seventh region of the earth.

4. For ye have brought it to pass that men who do the worst things
shall be called beloved of the Daevas, separating themselves from
Good Thought, departing from the will of Mazda Ahura and from
Right.

5. Thereby ye defrauded mankind of happy life and immortality,
by the deed which he and the Bad Spirit together with Bad Thought
and Bad Word taught you, ye Daevas and the Liars, so as to ruin
(mankind).

6. The many sins by which he has succeeded in being famous whether
by these it shall be thus, this Thou Knowest by the Best Thought,
O Ahura, Thou who art mindful of each person's deserts. In Thy
Dominion, O Mazda, and that of Asha, shall your decision thereon
be observed.

7. None of these sins will the understanding commit, in eagerness
to attain the blessing that shall be proclaimed, we know, through
the glowing metal — sins the issue of which, O Ahura Mazda, Thou
knowest best.

8. Among these sinners, we know, Yima was included, Vivanghen's
son, who desiring to satisfy men gave our people flesh of the
ox to eat. From these shall I be separated by Thee, O Mazda, at
last.

9. The teacher of evil destroys the lore, he by his teaching
destroys the design of life, he prevents the possession of Good
Thought from being prized. These words of my spirit I wail unto
you, O Mazda, and to the Right.

10. He it is that destroys, who declares that the Ox and the Sun
are the worst things to behold with the eyes, and hath made the
pious into liars, and desolates the pastures and lifts his weapon
against the righteous man.

11. It is they, the liars, who destroy life, who are mightily
determined to deprive matron and master of the enjoyment of their
heritage, in that they would prevent the righteous, O Mazda, from
the Best Thought.

12. Since they by their lore would pervert men from the best doing,
Mazda uttered evil against them, who destroy the life of the Ox
with shouts of joy, by whom Grehma and his tribe are preferred
to the Right and the Karapan and the lordship of them that seek
after the Lie.

13. Since Grehma shall attain the realm in the dwelling of the
Worst Thought, he and the destroyers of life, O Mazda, they shall
lament in their longing for the message of Thy prophet, who will
stay them from beholding the Right.

14. To his undoing Grehma, and the Kavis, have long devoted their
purpose and energies, for they set themselves to help the liar,
and that it may be said, "The Ox shall be slain that it may
kindle the Averter of Death to help us."

15. Thereby hath come to ruin the Karapan and the Kavi community,
through those whom they will not have to rule over their life.
These shall be born away from them both to the dwelling of Good
Thought.

16. ..., who hast power, O Mazda Ahura, on him who threatens to
be my undoing, that I may fetter the men of the Lie in their violence
against my friends.
