<h4>TO THE BOUNTIFUL IMMORTALS, AND THE INSTITUTIONS OF RELIGION.</h4>

1. I would worship these (the Bountiful Immortals) with my sacrifice,
those who rule aright, and who dispose (of all) aright, and this
one (especially) I would approach with my praise, (Ahura Mazda).
He is thus hymned (in our praise-songs). Yea, we worship in our
sacrifice that deity and lord, who is Ahura Mazda, the Creator,
the gracious helper, the maker of all good things; and we worship
in our sacrifice Zarathushtra Spitama, that chieftain (of the
rite).

2. And we would declare those institutions established for us,
exact (and undeviating as they are). And I would declare forth
those of Ahura Mazda, those of the Good Mind, and of Asha Vahishta
(who is Righteousness the Best), and those of Khshatra-vairya
(the Realm to be desired), and those of the Bountiful Aramaiti
(the Piety within us), and those of Weal and Immortality, and
those which appertain to the body of the Kine, and to the Kine's
soul, and those which appertain to Ahura Mazda's Fire, (3) and
those of Sraosha (Obedience) the blessed, and of Rashnu the most
just, and those of Mithra of the wide pastures, and of (the good
and) holy Wind, and of the good Mazdayasnian Religion, and of
the good and pious Prayer for blessings, and those of the good
and pious Prayer which frees one from belying, and the good and
pious Prayer for blessing against unbelieving words. 4. (And these
we would declare) in order that we may attain unto that speech
which is uttered with (true) religious zeal, or that we may be
as prophets of the provinces, that we may succor him who lifts
his voice (for Mazda), that we may be as prophets who smite with
victory, the befriended of Ahura Mazda, and persons the most useful
to Him, holy men (indeed) who think good thoughts, and speak good
words, and do good deeds. 5. That he may approach us with the
Good Mind, and that (our souls) may advance in good, let it thus
come; yea, 'how may my soul advance in good? let it thus advance.'

6. We praise the flood and ebb of the good waters, and their
roar, and that high Ahura, the royal Apam-napat, the glittering
one, of the fleet horses; and this for the sacrifice, and homage,
and propitiation, and praise of the entire holy creation; and
may Sraosha (Obedience) be here (to aid us).

7. (Yea), we sacrifice to Sraosha, Obedience the blessed.
