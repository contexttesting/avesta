<h4>TO AHURA, THE HOLY CREATION, THE FRAVASHIS OF THE JUST, AND
THE BOUNTIFUL IMMORTALS.</h4>

1. Thus therefore do we worship Ahura Mazda, who made the Kine
(the living creation), and the (embodied) Righteousness (which
is incarnate in the clean), and the waters, and the wholesome
plants, the stars, and the earth, and all (existing) objects that
are good. 2. Yea, we worship Him for His Sovereign Power and His
greatness, beneficent (as they are), and with priority among the
Yazads who abide beside the Kine (and care for her protection
and support).

3. And we worship Him under His name as Lord, to Mazda dear,
the most beneficent (of names). We worship him with our bones,
and with our flesh, (with our bodies and our life). And we worship
the Fravashis of the saints, of holy men, and holy women; (4)
and Righteousness the Best do we worship, the most beauteous,
the Bountiful Immortal and that which is endowed with light in
all things good.

5. And we worship the Good Mind (of the Lord), and His Sovereign
Power, and the Good Faith, the good law of our thrift, and Piety
the ready mind (within Thy folk)!
