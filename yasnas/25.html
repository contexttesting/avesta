them, and Hadhanaepata, and lifted up with sanctity, and we worship
the Haoma-water for the beneficial waters; and we worship the
two, the stone mortar and the iron mortar; (3) and we worship
this plant for the Baresman and the well-timed prayer for blessings
which has approached (in its proper place within the ritual course),

Religion, and the heard recital of the Gathas, and the well-timed
prayer for blessings of the holy lord of the ritual order which
has approached, and these wood-billets with the perfume, (even)
thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! and we worship all good
objects which are Mazda-made, and which contain (and are) the
seed of Righteousness.

Raman Hvastra; and we worship the shining sun, the resplendent,
the immortal, of the fleet horses.

within thee; and we worship the most true religious Knowledge,
Mazda-made and holy, and the good Mazdayasnian law.

6. And we worship the Mathra Spenta verily glorious (as it is),
even the law pronounced against the Daevas, the Zarathushtrian
law, and its long descent; yea, we worship the good Mazdayasnian
Religion, and the Mathra which is heart-devoted and bounteous
(imparting heart's devotion to the saint); yea, we worship the
Mazdayasnian Religion maintained in the understanding of the saint;
and we honor that science which is the Mathra Spenta, and the
innate understanding Mazda-made, and the derived understanding,
heard with ear, and Mazda-made.

lord of the ritual order; and we worship all the Fires, and Mount
Ushi-darena (which holds the light) Mazda-made and holy, the Yazad

Yazad; and every holy earthly Yazad (who exists)!
