+ NOTE:  THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES WITH INCREASED FULLNESS OF EXPRESSION.

1. We worship Ahura Mazda, the holy lord of the ritual order,
who disposes (all) aright, the greatest Yazad, who is also the
most beneficent, and the one who causes the settlements to advance,
the creator of good creatures; yea, we worship Him with these
offered Zaothras and with truthfully and scrupulously delivered
words; and we worship every holy Yazad of the heaven (as well)!

2. And we worship Zarathushtra Spitama in our sacrifice, the
holy lord of the ritual order with these Zaothras and with faithfully
delivered words; and we worship every holy earthly Yazad as we
worship him; and we worship also the Fravashi of Zarathushtra
Spitama, the saint. And we worship the utterances of Zarathushtra
and his religion, his faith and his lore.

3. And we worship the former religions of the world devoted to
Righteousness which were instituted at the creation, the holy
religions of the Creator Ahura Mazda, the resplendent and glorious.
And we worship Vohu Manah (the Good Mind), and Asha Vahishta (who
is Righteousness the Best), and Khshathra-vairya, the Kingdom
to be desired, and the good and bountiful Armaiti (true piety
in the believers), and Haurvatat and Ameretat (our Weal and Immortality).

4. Yea, we worship the Creator Ahura Mazda and the Fire, Ahura
Mazda's son, and the good waters which are Mazda-made and holy,
and the resplendent sun of the swift horses, and the moon with
the seed of cattle (in his beams); and we worship the star Tishtrya,
the lustrous and glorious; and we worship the soul of the Kine
of blessed endowment, (5) and its Creator Ahura Mazda; and we
worship Mithra of the wide pastures, and Sraosha (Obedience) the
blessed, and Rashnu the most just, and the good, heroic, bountiful
Fravashis of the saints, and the Blow-of-victory Ahura-given (as
it is). And we worship Raman Hvastra, and the bounteous Wind of
blessed gift, (6) and (its) Creator Ahura Mazda, and the good
Mazdayasnian Religion, and the good Blessedness and Arshtat.
And we worship the heaven and the earth of blessed gift, and the
bounteous Mathra, and the stars without beginning (to their course),
self-disposing as they are.

7. And we worship the glorious works of Righteousness in which
the souls of the dead find satisfaction and delight [(Pazand)
which are the Fravashis of the saints], and we worship (Heaven)
the best world of the saints, shining, all glorious.

8. And we worship the two, the milk-offering and the libation,
the two which cause the waters to flow forth, and the plants to
flourish, the two foes who meet the Dragon demon-made; and who
are set to meet, to defeat, and to put to flight, that cheat,
the Pairika, and to contradict the insulting malice of the Ashemaogha
(the persecuting heretic) and that of the unholy tyrant full of
death.

9. And we worship all waters and all plants, and all good men
and all good women. And we worship all these Yazads, heavenly
and earthly, who are beneficent and holy.

10. And we worship thee (our) dwelling-place who art the (earth,
our) bounteous Armaiti, and Thee, O Ahura Mazda, O holy Lord of
this abode! which is the home of healthy herds and healthy men,
and of those who are both endowed with health and lover(s) of
the ritual right.
(Response of the individual worshipper (?).) Wherefore whichever
of persons, or whatever of bodily influences, is most helpful
and preserving in that abode (thus owned by Mazda) let this meet
me in mine abode, and there may it abide for summer and for winter.
(Or let that one meet me in all my house, in whom are what of
influences are the most mighty power for the body and the person's
life; yea, let that one meet me there, and there abide for summer
and for winter (for my help)!)
