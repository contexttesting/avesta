(first), who worshipped both the protector and the Creator, who
are (both) creating all things in the creation.

3. For his splendor and his glory, for his might, and the blow
which smites with victory, I will worship him with the Yasna of

and all the deeds well done (for him), both those that have been
done (in times gone by), and those which are yet to be done (for
him in times to come).

rain(-drops as they fall); yea, fleeter than the clouds, or well-winged
birds, or the we shot arrow as it flies, (29) which overtake these
swift ones all, as they fly after them pursuing, but which are
never overtaken when they flee, which plunge away from both the
weapons (hurled on this side and on that) and draw Sraosha with

luminous, as he holds in both the hands and poizes his knife-like
battle-ax, which flies as of itself, and to cleave the Daevas'
skulls, (32) to hew down Angra Mainyu, the wicked, and to hew
