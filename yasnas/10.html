1. Let the Demon-gods and Goddesses fly far away from hence,
and let the good Sraosha make here his home! [And may the good
Blessedness here likewise dwell], and may she here spread delight
and peace within this house, Ahura's, which is sanctified by Haoma,
bringing righteousness (to all).

2. At the first force of thy pressure, O intelligent! I praise
thee with my voice, while I grasp at first thy shoots. At thy
next pressure, O intelligent! I praise thee with my voice, when
as with full force of a man I crush thee down.

3. I praise the cloud that waters thee, and the rains which make
thee grow on the summits of the mountains; and I praise thy lofty
mountains where the Haoma branches spread.

4. This wide earth do I praise, expanded far (with paths), the
productive, the full bearing, thy mother, holy plant! Yea, I praise
the lands where thou dost grow, sweet-scented, swiftly spreading,
the good growth of the Lord. O Haoma, thou growest on the mountains,
apart on many paths, and there still may'st thou flourish. The
springs of Righteousness most verily thou art, (and the fountains
of the ritual find their source in thee)!

5. Grow (then) because I pray to thee on all thy stems and branches,
in all thy shoots (and tendrils) increase thou through my word!

6. Haoma grows while he is praised, and the man who praises him
is therewith more victorious. The lightest pressure of thee, Haoma,
thy feeblest praise, the slightest tasting of thy juice, avails
to the thousand-smiting of the Daevas.

7. Wasting doth vanish from that house, and-with it foulness,
whither in verity they bear thee, and where thy praise in truth
is sung, the drink of Haoma, famed, health-bringing (as thou art).
[(Pazand) to his village and abode they bear him.]

8. All other toxicants go hand in hand with Rapine of the bloody
spear, but Haoma's stirring power goes hand in hand with friendship.
[Light is the drunkenness of Haoma (Pazand).]
Who as a tender son caresses Haoma, forth to the bodies of such
persons Haoma comes to heal.

9. Of all the healing virtues, Haoma, whereby thou art a healer,
grant me some. Of all the victorious powers, whereby thou art
a victor, grant me some. A faithful praiser will I be to thee,
O Haoma, and a faithful praiser (is) a better (thing) than Righteousness
the Best; so hath the Lord, declaring (it), decreed.

10. Swift and wise hath the well-skilled Deity created thee; swift
and wise on high Haraiti did He, the well-skilled, plant thee.

11. And taught (by implanted instinct) on every side, the bounteous
birds have carried thee to the Peaks-above-the-eagles, to the
mount's extremest summit, to the gorges and abysses, to the heights
of many pathways, to the snow-peaks ever whitened.

12. There, Haoma, on the ranges dost thou grow of many kinds.
Now thou growest of milky whiteness, and now thou growest golden;
and forth thine healing liquors flow for the inspiring of the
pious. So terrify away from me the (death's) aim of the curser.
So terrify and crush his thought who stands as my maligner.

13. Praise be to thee, O Haoma, (for he makes the poor man's thoughts
as great as any of the richest whomsoever.) Praise be to Haoma,
(for he makes the poor man's thoughts as great as when mind reacheth
culmination.) With manifold retainers dost thou, O Haoma, endow
the man who drinks thee mixed with milk; yea, more prosperous
thou makest him, and more endowed with mind.

14. Do not vanish from me suddenly like milk-drops in the rain;
let thine exhilarations go forth ever vigorous and fresh; and
let them come to me with strong effect. Before thee, holy Haoma,
thou bearer of the ritual truth, and around thee would I cast
this body, a body which (as all) may see (is fit for gift and)
grown.

15. I renounce with vehemence the murderous woman's emptiness,
the Jaini's, hers, with intellect dethroned. She vainly thinks
to foil us, and would beguile both Fire-priest and Haoma; but
she herself, deceived therein, shall perish. And when she sits
at home, and wrongly eats of Haoma's offering, priest's mother
will that never make her, nor give her holy sons!

16. To five do I belong, to five others do I not; of the good
thought am I, of the evil am I not; of the good word am I, of
the evil am I not; of the good deed am I, and of the evil, not.

To Obedience am I given, and to deaf disobedience, not; to the
saint do I belong, and to the wicked, not; and so from this on
till the ending shall be the spirits' parting. (The two shall
here divide.)

17. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma, Mazda-made.
Good is Haoma, Mazda-made. All the plants of Haoma praise I, on
the heights of lofty mountains, in the gorges of the valleys,
in the clefts (of sundered hill-sides) cut for the bundles bound
by women. From the silver cup I pour Thee to the golden chalice
over. Let me not thy (sacred) liquor spill to earth, of precious
cost.

18. These are thy Gathas, holy Haoma, these thy songs, and these
thy teachings, and these thy truthful ritual words, health-imparting,
victory-giving, from harmful hatred healing giving.

19. These and thou art mine, and forth let thine exhilarations
flow; bright and sparkling let them hold on their (steadfast)
way; for light are thine exhilaration(s), and flying lightly come
they here. Victory-giving smiteth Haoma, victory-giving is it
worshipped; with this Gathic word we praise it.

20. Praise to the Kine; praise and victory (be) spoken to her!
Food for the Kine, and pasture! 'For the Kine let thrift use toil;
yield thou us food.'

21. We worship the yellow lofty one; we worship Haoma who causes
progress, who makes the settlements advance; we worship Haoma
who drives death afar; yea, we worship all the Haoma plants. And
we worship (their) blessedness, and the Fravashi of Zarathushtra
Spitama, the saint.
