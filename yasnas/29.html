1. Unto you wailed the Ox-soul, "For whom did ye fashion
me? Who created me? Violence and rapine (and) savagery hath oppressed
me, and outrage and might. I have no other herdsman than you;
prepare for me then the blessings of pasture."

2. Then the Ox-Creator asked of the Right: "Hast thou a
judge for the Ox, that ye may be able to appoint him zealous tendance
as well as fodder? Whom do ye will to be his lord, who may drive
off violence together with the followers of the Lie?"

3. To him the Right replied: "There is for the Ox no helper
that can keep him away. Those yonder have no knowledge how right-doers
act towards the lowly".
(The Ox-Creator): "Strongest of beings is he to whose help
I come at call".

4. (Asha) "Mazda knoweth best the purposes that have been
wrought already by demons and by mortals, and that shall be wrought
hereafter. He, Ahura, is the decider. So shall it be as he shall
will."

5. (The Ox-Creator) "To Ahura with outspread hands we twain
would pray, my soul and that of the pregnant cow, so that we twain
urge Mazda with entreaties. Destruction is not for the right-living,
nor for the cattle-tender at the hands of Liars."

6. Then spake Ahura Mazda himself, who knows the law with wisdom:
"There is found no lord or judge according to the Right Order
for the Creator hath formed thee for the cattle-tender and the
farmer."

7. This ordinance about the fat hath Ahura Mazda, one in will
with Right, created for cattle, and the milk for them that crave
nourishment, by his command, the holy one.
(The Ox and Cow:) "Whom hast thou, O Good Thought, among
men, who may care for us twain?"

8. (Vohu Manah:) He is known to me here who alone hath heard
our commands, even Zarathushtra Spitama; he willeth to make known
our thoughts, O Mazda, and those of the Right. So let us bestow
on him charm of speech.

9. Then the Ox-Soul lamented: "That I must be content with
the ineffectual word of an impotent man for my protector, when
I wish for one that commands mightily! When ever shall there be
one who shall give him (the Ox) effective help?"

10. (Zarathushtra:) Do ye, O Ahura, grant them strength, and O
Asha, and O Good Thought, that dominion, whereby he (the Savior)
could produce good dwellings and peace. I also have realized thee,
Mazda, as the first to accomplish this.

11. "Where are Right and Good Thought and Dominion? So, ye
men, acknowledge me, for instruction, Mazda, for the great society."

(The Ox and Cow:) "O Ahura, now is help ours, we will be
ready to serve those that are of you."
