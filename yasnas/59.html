<h4>MUTUAL BLESSINGS.</h4>

1-17. (See Y17.1-17.)

18-27. (See Y26.1-10.)

28. We worship Verethraghna, the Ahura-made, the victorious blow;
and we worship the Saoshyant, who smites with victory; and we
sacrifice to this Baresman with its Zaothra and its girdle (which
is its band) and which is spread with sanctity. And we sacrifice
to (our) own soul(s), and to (our) own Fravashi(s).

29. (See Y17.19.)

30. (The Ratu speaks): O thou good (servant of the Lord)! may
that be thine which is better than the good; may'st thou acquire
that which is (thine) own in the Zaothra; may'st thou attain to
that reward which the Zaotar has been obtaining, who is far advanced
in his good thoughts, and words, and deeds.

31. (The Zaotar speaks): May that happen to you (likewise) which
is better than the good, and may that not happen which is worse
than the evil, and may that likewise not be my lot. 32. As (our)
Ahu (is) excellent, so (is our) Ratu (one who rules) from his
Righteousness, a creator of mental goodness, and of life's actions
done for Mazda, and the Kingdom (is) to Ahura which to the poor
will offer a nurturer. A blessing is Asha called the Best, &c.
We sacrifice to the Ahuna-vairya; we sacrifice to Asha Vahishta
the most beautiful, the Bountiful Immortal. And we sacrifice to
the Fshusho-mathra, the by-spoken. And we sacrifice to the entire
collection of the Praises of the Yasna; (yea), to the Yasna Praises
which were instituted in the world of yore.
