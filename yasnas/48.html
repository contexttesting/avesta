1. When at the Recompensings the Right shall smite the Liar,
so that what was long since made known shall be assigned to eternity
to Daevas and men, then will it exalt with thy blessings, Ahura,
him who prays to thee.

2. Tell me, for thou art he that knows, O Ahura: - shall the
Righteous smite the Liar before the retributions come which thou
hast conceived? That were indeed a message to bless the world.

3. For him that knows, that is the best of teachings which the
beneficent Ahura teaches through the Right, he the holy one, even
thyself, O Mazda, that knows the secret lore through the wisdom
of Good Thought.

4. Whoso, O Mazda, makes his thought (now) better, (now) worse,
and likewise his Self by action and by word, and follows his own
inclinations, wishes, and choices, he shall in thy purpose be
in a separate place at last.

5. Let good rulers rule us, not evil rulers with the actions
of the Good Lore, O Piety! Perfect thou for man, O thou most good,
the future birth, and for the cow skilled husbandry. Let her grow
fat for our nourishing.

6. She (Armaiti) will give us peaceful dwelling, she will give
lasting life and strength, she the beloved of Good Thought. For
it (the cattle) Mazda Ahura made the plants to grow at the birth
of the First Life, through Right.

7. Violence must be put down! against cruelty make a stand, ye
who would make sure of the reward of Good Thought through Right,
to whose company the holy man belongs. His dwelling place shall
be in thy House, O Ahura.

8. Is the possession of thy good Dominion, Mazda, is that of
thy Destiny assured to me Ahura? Will thy manifestation, O thou
Right, be welcome to the pious, even the weighing of actions by
the Good Spirit [Spenta Mainyu -JHP]?

9. When shall I know whether ye have power, O Mazda and Right,
over everyone whose destructiveness is a menace to me? Let the
revelation of Good Thought be confirmed unto me; the future deliverer
should know how his own destiny shall be.

10. When, O Mazda, will the nobles understand the message? When
will thou smite the filthiness of this intoxicant, through which
the Karapans evilly deceive, and the wicked lords of the lands
with purpose fell?<sup>1</sup>


   + NOTE: 1. Martin Schwartz tr: "When will they ban(ish) the filth
  of that ditch/reciprocity-gift whereby ... the karapans commit
  plunder", 'thus Yasna 48.10 contains no reference to intoxication,
  let alone condemnation of haoma.' Flattery: 'the passage ... has
  nothing remotely to do with sauma.' (Flattery & Schwartz,
  <i>Haoma and Harmaline</i>, 1989, pp. 105, 6.)


11. When, O Mazda, shall Piety come with Right, with Dominion
the happy dwelling rich with pasture? Who are they that will make
peace with the bloodthirsty Liars? To whom will the Lore of Good
Thought come?

12. These shall be the deliverers [Saoshyants -JHP] of the provinces, who exert
themselves, O Good Thought in their action, O Asha, to fulfill
their duty, face to face with thy command, O Mazda. For these
are the appointed smiters of Violence.
