<h4>PRAISE TO AHURA AND THE IMMORTALS; PRAYER FOR THE PRACTICE
AND DIFFUSION OF THE FAITH.</h4>

1. We sacrifice to Ahura Mazda, the holy Lord of the ritual order,
and to the Bountiful Immortals, who rule aright, who dispose of
all aright; and we sacrifice to the entire creation of the clean,
the spiritual and the mundane, with the longing blessing of the
beneficent ritual, with the longing blessing of the benignant
Religion, the Mazdayasnian Faith.

2. We are praisers of good thoughts, of good words, and of good
actions, of those now and those hereafter [(Pazand) of those being
done; and of those completed]. We implant (?) them (with our homage,
and we do this) the more, and yet the more since we are (praisers)
of the good (from whom they spring).

3. That, therefore, would we choose, O Ahura Mazda! and thou,
O Righteousness the beauteous! that we should think, and speak,
and do those thoughts, and words, and deeds, among actual good
thoughts, and words, and actions, which are the best for both
the worlds; (4) and together with these gifts (?) and actions
which are thus the best, we would pray for the Kine (which represents
the pure creation), that she may have comfort and have fodder
from the famed! and from the humble, from the potent and the weak.

5. To the best of good rulers (is) verily the Kingdom, because
we render and ascribe it to Him, and make it thoroughly His own
(?), to Mazda Ahura do we ascribe it, and to Righteousness the
Best.

6. As thus both man or woman knows (the duty), both thoroughly
and truly, so let him, or her, declare it and fulfill it, and
inculcate it upon those who may perform it as it is. 7. We would
be deeply mindful of Your sacrifice and homage, Yours, O Ahura
Mazda! and the best, (and we would be mindful) of the nurture
of the Kine. And that let us inculcate, and perform for You according
as we may; and (for) such (praisers as we are).

8. Under the shelter of the ritual Order let us do so in the
active fulfillment of its (precepts) toward every one of the (clean)
and better creatures which are fit to live, with a gift for both
the worlds.

9. Yea, those words and sayings, O Ahura Mazda! we would proclaim
as Righteousness, and as of the better mind (?); and we would
make Thee the one who both supports (us in our proclamation) of
them, and who throws still further light upon them (as they are),

10. And by reason of Thy Righteous Order, Thy Good Mind, and Thy
Sovereign Power, and through the instrumentality of our praises
of Thee, O Ahura Mazda! and for the purpose of (still further)
praises, by Thy spoken words, and for (still further) spoken words,
through Thy Yasna, and for (still further) Yasnas (would we thus
proclaim them, and make Thee the bestower of our light).
