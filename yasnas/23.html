+ NOTE: THE FRAVASHIS OF THE SAINTS; PRAYERS FOR THEIR APPROACH.

1. I desire to approach with my praise those Fravashis which
have existed from of old, the Fravashis of the houses, and of
the villages, of the communities, and of the provinces, which
hold the heaven in its place apart, and the water, land, and cattle,
which hold the children in the wombs safely enclosed apart so
that they do not miscarry.

2. And I desire to approach toward the Fravashi of Ahura Mazda,
and with my praise, and for those of the Bountiful Immortals,
with all the holy Fravashis which are those of the heavenly Yazads.
And I desire to approach the Fravashi of Gaya Maretan
[Gayomard] (the life-man)
in my worship with my praise, and for that of Zarathushtra Spitama,
and for those of Kavi Vishtaspa, and of Isat-vastra, the Zarathushtrian,
with all the holy Fravashis of the other ancient counselors as
well. 3. And I desire in my worship to approach toward every holy
Fravashi whosesoever it may be, and wheresoever dead upon this
earth (its possessor may have lain), the pious woman, or the girl
of tender years, the maiden diligent (among the cattle) in the
field (who) may have dwelt (here; yea, all) which are now worshipped
from this house, which are attentive to, and which attain to (our)
good Yasnas and (our) homage. 4. Yea, I desire to approach the
Fravashis of the saints with my praise redoubted (as they are)
and overwhelming, the Fravashis of those who held to the ancient
lore, and the Fravashis of the next-of-kin; and I desire to approach
toward the Fravashi of mine own soul in my worship with my praise;
and I desire therewith to approach toward all the lords of the
ritual, and with praise; and I desire to approach all the good
Yazads with my praise, the heavenly and the earthly, who are meet
for sacrifice and homage, because of Righteousness the Best!
