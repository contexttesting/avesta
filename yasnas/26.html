+ NOTE: THE FRAVASHIS; SACRIFICE AND PRAISE TO THEM.

1. I praise, invoke, and weave my hymn to the good, heroic, and
bountiful Fravashis of the saints; (and having invoked these,
then) we worship the Nmanyas, and the Visyas, and the Zantumas,
and the Dahvyumas, and the Zarathushtrotemas.

2. And of all these prior Fravashis, we worship here the Fravashi
of Ahura Mazda, which is the greatest and the best, the most beautiful
and the firmest, the most wise and the best in form, and the one
that attains the most its ends because of Righteousness. 3. And
(having invoked them) hither, we worship the good, heroic, bountiful
Fravashis of the holy ones, those of the Bountiful Immortals,
the brilliant, of effective glance, the lofty, the devoted, the
swift ones of the creatures of Ahura who are imperishable and
holy.

4. And (having invoked them) hither, we worship the spirit and
conscience, the intelligence and soul and Fravashi of those holy
men and women who early heard the lore and commands (of God),
and loved and strove after Righteousness, the ritual truth; and
we worship the soul of the Kine of blessed gift. 5. And (having
invoked it) hither, we worship the Fravashi of Gaya Maretan [Gayomard] the
holy, and the sanctity and Fravashi of Zarathushtra Spitama the
saint; and we worship the Fravashi of Kavi Vishtasp the holy,
and that of Isat-vastra the Zarathushtrian, the saint.

6. And (having invoked them) hither, we worship the life, conscience,
intelligence, soul and Fravashi of the next of kin, of the saints
male and female who have striven after the ritual truth, which
are those of the dead and living saints, and which are those also
of men as yet unborn, of the future prophets who will help on
the renovation, and complete the human progress, with them all.

7. And (having invoked them) hither, we worship the souls of
the dead [(Pazand) which are the Fravashis of the saints]; and
of all the next of kin who have passed away in this house, of
the Aethra-paitis (the teachers) and of the disciples; yea, of
all holy men and women; (8) and we worship the Fravashis of all
the holy teachers and disciples; and of all the saints both male
and female.

9. (And having invoked them) hither we worship the Fravashis
of all the holy children who fulfill the deeds of piety; and we
worship the Fravashis of the saints within the province; and those
of the saints without the province. 10. We worship the Fravashis
of (those) holy men and holy women; we worship all the good, heroic,
bountiful Fravashis of the saints from Gaya Maretan [Gayomard] (the first
created) to the Saoshyant, the victorious.

11. Yea, we worship all the Fravashis of the saints, and we worship
the souls of the dead [(Pazand) which are the Fravashis of the
saints]!
