<h4>TO THE AHURIAN ONE.</h4>

1. I am now offering this Zaothra here with sanctity, together
with the Haoma and the flesh, and the Hadhanaepata lifted up with
sacred regularity as to thee, O Ahurian One, for the propitiation
of Ahura Mazda, of the Bountiful Immortals, of Sraosha (Obedience)
the blessed, and of the Fire of Ahura Mazda, the ritual's lofty
lord.

2. (=Y7,5-19.)

3. (=Y22, Y28.24-27.)
