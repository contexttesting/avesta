<h2>THE HOM YASHT</h2>

1. At the hour of Havani, Haoma came to Zarathushtra, as he served
the (sacred) Fire, and sanctified (its flame), while he sang aloud
the Gathas. And Zarathushtra asked him: Who art thou, O honorable one<sup>1</sup>! who art
of all the incarnate world the most beautiful in Thine own body of those
whom I have, seen, (thou) glorious [immortal]?

   + NOTE: 1. So Hum2 138; Mills has 'O man'.


2. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, the holy one who driveth death
afar: I am, O Zarathushtra Haoma, the holy and driving death afar;
pray to me, O Spitama, prepare me for the taste. Praise me so that
also the other Saoshyants [benefactors] may praise me<sup>2</sup>.


   + NOTE: 2. So Hum2 74. Mills reads. 'Praise toward
  me in (Thy) praises as the other [Saoshyants] praise.'


3. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Unto Haoma be the praise. What
man, O Haoma! first prepared thee for the corporeal world? What
award<sup>3</sup> was offered him? what gain did he acquire?


   + NOTE: 3. (ashish) Mills relates Ashi to Asha and reads 'blessedness'.


4. Thereupon did Haoma answer me, he the holy one, and driving
death afar: Vivanghvant was the first of men who prepared me for
the incarnate world. This award<sup>4</sup> was offered him; this gain
did he acquire, that to him was born a son who was Yima, called
the brilliant, (he of the many flocks, the most glorious of those
yet born, the sunlike-one of men), that he made from his authority
both herds and people free from dying, both plants and waters
free from drought, and men could eat inexhaustible<sup>5</sup> food.


   + NOTE: 4. Mills: 'blessedness'.
  5. So Malandra, Mills reads 'imperishable'.


5. In the reign of brave<sup>6</sup> Yima was there neither cold
nor heat, there was neither age nor death, nor envy demon-made.
Like teenagers<sup>7</sup> walked the two forth, son and father, in
their stature and their form, so long as Yima, son of Vivanghvant
ruled, he of the many herds!


   + NOTE: 6. (Yimahe xshathre aurvahe) So Malandra, Mills reads 'swift of motion'.
  Wolff reads 'Herrschaft' (cf B542).
  7. Mills: 'fifteen-yearlings'.


6. Who was the second man, O Haoma! who prepared thee for the
corporeal world? What award<sup>8</sup> was offered him? what gain did
he acquire?


   + NOTE: 8. Mills: 'sanctity'.


7. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, he the holy one, and driving
death afar: Athwya was the second who prepared-me for the corporeal
world. This award<sup>9</sup> was given him, this gain did he acquire,
that to him a son was born, Thraetaona of the mighty clan<sup>10</sup>,


   + NOTE: 9. Mills: 'blessedness'.
  10. (vîsô sûrayau) Following Gershevitch.
  Mills reads 'heroic tribe'.  Malandra reads 'mighty house'.


8. Who smote Azhi Dahaka<sup>11</sup>, three-jawed and triple-headed,
six-eyed, with thousand perceptions<sup>12</sup>, and of mighty strength, a lie-demon
[druj] of the Daevas, evil for our settlements, and wicked, whom the
evil spirit Angra Mainyu made as the most mighty Druj [against
the corporeal world], and for the murder of (our) settlements,
and to slay the (homes) of Asha!


   + NOTE: 11. Mills: 'the dragon Dahaka'.
  12. (hazanrâ-yaoxshtîm) Mills: 'thousand powers'.


9. Who was the third man, O Haoma! who prepared thee for the
corporeal world? What award<sup>13</sup> was given him? what gain did
he acquire?


   + NOTE: 13. Mills: 'blessedness'.


10. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, the holy one, and driving death
afar: Thrita, [the most helpful of the Samids], was the third man
who prepared me for the corporeal world. This award was
given him, this gain did he acquire, that to him two son were
born, Urvakhshaya and Keresaspa, the one a judge confirming order,
the other a youth of great ascendant, curly-haired<sup>14</sup>, bludgeon-bearing.


   + NOTE: 14. Mills: 'blessedness'.
  15. Mills: 'ringlet-headed'.


11. He who smote the horny dragon swallowing men, and swallowing
horses, poisonous, and green of color over which, as thick as
thumbs are, greenish poison flowed aside, on whose back once Keresaspa
cooked his meat in iron caldron at the noonday meal; and the deadly,
scorched, upstarted, and springing off, dashed out the water as
it boiled. Headlong fled affrighted manly-minded Keresaspa.

12. Who was the fourth man who prepared thee, O Haoma! for the
corporeal world? What blessedness was given him? what gain did
he acquire?

13. Thereupon gave Haoma answer, he the holy, and driving death
afar: Pourushaspa was the fourth man who prepared me for the corporeal
world. This blessedness was given him, this gain did he acquire,
that thou, O Zarathushtra! wast born to him, the just, in Pourushaspa's
house, the Daeva's foe, the friend of Mazda's lore, (14) famed
in Airyana Vaejah; and thou, O Zarathushtra! didst recite the
first the Ahuna-vairya, four times intoning it, and with verses
kept apart [(Pazand) each time with louder and still louder voice].

15. And thou didst cause, O Zarathushtra! all the demon-gods to
vanish in the ground who aforetime flew about this earth in human
shape (and power. This hast thou done), thou who hast been the
strongest, and the staunchest, the most active, and the swiftest,
and (in every deed) the most victorious in the two spirits' world.

16. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma. Good is Haoma,
and the well-endowed, exact and righteous in its nature, and good
inherently, and healing, beautiful of form, and good in deed,
and most successful in its working, golden-hued, with bending
sprouts. As it is the best for drinking, so (through its sacred
stimulus) is it the most nutritious for the soul.

17. I make my claim on thee, O yellow one! for inspiration. I
make my claim on thee for strength; I make my claim on thee for
victory; I make my claim on thee for health and healing (when
healing is my need); I make my claim on thee for progress and
increased prosperity, and vigor of the entire frame, and for understanding,
of each adorning kind, and for this, that I may have free course
among our settlements, having power where I will, overwhelming
angry malice, and a conqueror of lies.

18. Yea, I make my claim on thee that I may overwhelm the angry
hate of haters, of the Daevas and of mortals, of the sorcerers
and sirens, of the tyrants, and the Kavis, of the Karpans, murderous
bipeds, of the sanctity-destroyers, the profane apostate bipeds,
of the wolves four-footed monsters, of the invading host, wide-fronted,
which with stratagems advance.

19. This first blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that
drivest death afar! I beseech of thee for (heaven), the best life
of the saints, the radiant, all-glorious.
This second blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest
death afar! this body's health (before that blest life is attained).

This third blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest
death afar! the long vitality of life.

20. This fourth blessing I beseech of thee, O Haoma, thou that
drivest death afar! that I may stand forth on this earth with
desires gained, and powerful, receiving satisfaction, overwhelming
the assaults of hate, and conquering the lie.
This fifth blessing, O Haoma, I beseech of thee, thou that drivest
death afar! that I may stand victorious on earth, conquering in
battles, overwhelming the assaults of hate, and conquering the
lie.

21. This sixth blessing I ask of thee, O Haoma, thou that drivest
death afar! that we may get good warning of the thief, good warning
of the murderer, see first the bludgeon-bearer, get first sight
of the wolf. May no one whichsoever get first the sight of us.
In the strife with each may we be they who get the first alarm!

22. Haoma grants to racers who would run a course with span both
speed and bottom (in their horses). Haoma grants to women come
to bed with child a brilliant offspring and a righteous line.

Haoma grants to those (how many!) who have long sat searching
books, more knowledge and more wisdom.

23. Haoma grants to those long maidens, who sit at home unwed,
good husbands, and that as soon as asked, he Haoma, the well-minded.

24. Haoma lowered Keresani, dethroned him from his throne, for
he grew so fond of power, that he treacherously said: No priest
behind (and watching) shall walk the lands for me, as a counselor
to prosper them, he would rob everything of progress, he would
crush the growth of all!

25. Hail to thee, O Haoma, who hast power as thou wilt, and by
thine inborn strength! Hail to thee, thou art well-versed in many
sayings, and true and holy words. Hail to thee for thou dost ask
no wily questions, but questionest direct.

26. Forth hath Mazda borne to thee, the star-bespangled girdle,
the spirit-made, the ancient one, the Mazdayasnian Faith.
So with this thou art begirt on the summits of the mountains,
for the spreading of the precepts, and the headings of the Mathra,
(and to help the Mathra's teacher),

27. O Haoma, thou house-lord, and thou clan-lord, thou tribe-lord,
and chieftain of the land, and thou successful learned teacher,
for aggressive strength I speak to thee, for that which smites
with victory, and for my body's saving, and for manifold delight!

28. Bear off from us the torment and the malice of the hateful.
Divert the angry foe's intent!
What man soever in this house is violent and wicked, what man
soever in this village, or this tribe, or province, seize thou
away the fleetness from his feet; throw thou a veil of darkness
o'er his mind; make thou his intellect (at once) a wreck!

29. Let not the man who harms us, mind or body, have power to
go forth on both his legs, or hold with both his hands, or see
with both his eyes, not the land (beneath his feet), or the herd
before his face.

30. At the aroused and fearful Dragon, green, and belching forth
his poison, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma,
hurl thy mace!
At the (murderous) bludgeon-bearer, committing deeds unheard of,
blood-thirsty, (drunk) with fury, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!

31. Against the wicked human tyrant, hurling weapons at the head,
for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy
mace!
Against the righteousness-disturber, the unholy life-destroyer,
thoughts and words of our religion well-delivering, yet in actions
never reaching, for the righteous saint that perishes, yellow
Haoma, hurl thy mace!

32. Against the body of the harlot, with her magic minds o'erthrowing
with (intoxicating) pleasures, to the lusts her person offering,
whose mind as vapor wavers as it flies before the wind, for the
righteous saint that perishes, yellow Haoma, hurl thy mace!
