<h4>PRELUDE TO THE HAOMA-OFFERING.</h4>

1. Three clean creatures (full of blessings) curse betimes while
yet invoking, the cow, the horse, and then Haoma. The cow cries
to her driver thus: Childless be thou, shorn of offspring evil-famed,
and slander-followed, who foddered fairly dost not use me, but
fattenest me for wife or children, and for thy niggard selfish
meal.

2. The horse cries to his rider thus: Be not spanner of the racers;
stretch no coursers to full-speed; do not stride across the fleetest,
thou, who dost not pray me swiftness in the meeting thick with
numbers, in the circuit thronged with men.

3. Haoma speaks his drinker thus: Childless be thou, shorn of
offspring, evil-famed, and slander-followed, who holdest me from
full outpouring, as a robber, skulls in-crushing. No head-smiter
am I ever, holy Haoma, far from death.

4. Forth my father gave an offering, tongue and left eye chose
Ahura, set apart for Haoma's meal.

5. Who this offering would deny me, eats himself, or prays it
from me, this which Mazda gave to bless me, tongue with left eye
(as my portion).

6. In his house is born no fire-priest, warrior ne'er in chariot
standing, never more the thrifty tiller. In his home be born Dahakas,
Murakas of evil practice, doing deeds of double nature.

7. Quick, cut off then Haoma's portion, gift of flesh for doughty
Haoma! Heed lest Haoma bind thee fettered, as he bound the fell
Turanian Frangrasyan (the murderous robber) fast in iron close-surrounded
in the mid-third of this earth!

8. Thereupon spake Zarathushtra: Praise to Haoma made by Mazda,
good is Haoma Mazda-made.

9. Who to us is one hereupon to thee (becomes) two, to be made
to three, for the five-making of the four, for the seven-making
of the sixth, who are your nine in the decade (?), who serve you
and with zeal.

10. To thee, O holy Haoma! bearer of the ritual sanctity, I offer
this my person which is seen (by all to be) mature, (and fit for
gift); to Haoma the effective do I offer it, and to the sacred
exhilaration which he bestows; and do thou grant to me (for this),
O holy Haoma! thou that drivest death afar, (Heaven) the best
world of the saints, shining, all brilliant.

11. (The Ashem Vohu, &c.)

12-15. May'st Thou rule at Thy will, O Lord....(Repeat Y8.5-7)!

16. I confess myself a Mazdayasnian of Zarathushtra's order.

17. I celebrate my praises for good thoughts, good words, and
good deeds for my thoughts, my speeches, and (my) actions. With
chanting praises I present all good thoughts, good words, and
good deeds, and with rejection I repudiate all evil thoughts,
and words, and deeds. 18. Here I give to you, O ye Bountiful Immortals!
sacrifice and homage with the mind, with words, deeds, and my
entire person; yea, (I offer) to you the flesh of my very body
(as your own). And I praise Righteousness. A blessing is Righteousness
(called) the Best, &c.
