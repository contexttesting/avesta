<h4>TO THE AHURIAN ONE, AND THE WATERS.</h4>

1. We offer this to thee, O Ahurian (daughter) of Ahura! as a
help (?) for life. If we have offended thee, let this Zaothra
then attain to thee (for satisfaction), for it is thine with its
Haoma, and its milk, and its Hadhanaepata. 2. And may'st thou
approach to me for milk and for libation, a Zaothra! as health,
for healing, and for progress, for growth and in preparation for
ceremonial merit, for good renown, for equanimity and for that
victory which makes the settlements advance.

3. Yea, we worship thee with sacrifice, O thou Ahurian (daughter)
of Ahura with the Zaothras of the good thought; and we worship,
O Ahura, one with the Zaothras of the good word and deed (4) for
the enlightenment of the thoughts, and words, and actions, for
preparation for the soul, for the settlement's advance, and to
prepare the saints endowed with ritual merit.

5. And grant me, O thou Ahurian One! Heaven, and to have an offspring
manly and legitimate, who may promote my house, my village, my
tribe and province, and the authority thereof.

6. We sacrifice to thee, O thou Ahurian one! And we sacrifice
to the sea Vouru-kasha, and to all waters upon earth, whether
standing, or running, or waters of the well, or spring-waters
which perennially flow, or the drippings of the rains, or the
irrigations of canals. 7. With this hymn from the (spirit of)
the Yasna do we worship thee, and with the homage which it offers
as it is the most legitimate Yasna, and homage of them (all) because
of Righteousness the Best. We sacrifice to the good waters, and
to the best, which Mazda created. 8. And we sacrifice to the two,
to the milk and to the libation, which make the waters flow, and
the plants sprout forth, opposing therein the Dragon Daeva-made,
for the arrest of that cheat the Pairika, and to contradict the
insulting malice of the Ashemaogha (the disturber and destroyer
of our Faith), and of the unholy tyrant full of death, and of
the human Daeva (worshipper) of hateful malice (and intent).

9. And may'st thou hear our sacrificial chants O thou Ahurian
(daughter) of Ahura! Yea, be propitiated by our Yasna, O Ahurian
one! and so may'st thou be present at our Yasna; may'st thou come
to us to help, as we chant our full-offered Yasht with the full
offering of Zaothras.

10. If any man shall sacrifice to you, O ye good waters, the Ahurian
ones of Ahura! with the best and most fitting Zaothras offered
piously, (11) to that man ye give both splendor and glory, with
health and vigor of the body and prominence of form; yea, to him
ye give possessions which entail abundant glory, and a legitimate
scion, and a long enduring life, and (Heaven at the last), the
best life of the saints, shining, all glorious. 12. And to me
also do ye now give it, to me who am offering this Yasna as a
priest.
(Response.) And to us Mazdayasnians who are likewise offering
sacrifice, do ye grant (both the desire and knowledge of the path
that is correct), to us colleagues, and disciples, Aethrapaitis
and Aethryas, men and women as well as children, and maidens of
the field, (13) who think good only, for the overwhelming of oppression
and of malice in the raids of the invader, and in face of foes
who hate. Grant to us both the desire of, and the knowledge of
that straightest path, the straightest because of Righteousness,
and of (Heaven) the best life of the Saints, shining, all glorious.
As the Ahu is excellent, so is the Ratu (one who rules) from the
Righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of life's actions
done for Mazda. And the kingdom (is) for Ahura, which to the poor
may offer nurture.

14. (The Zaotar speaks): I beseech with my benediction for a safe
abode, for a joyful and a long abode for the dwellers in this
village from whence these Zaothras (which I offer come). And I
pray in my benediction for a safe abode, and a quiet and a joyful
one, and a long abiding to every Mazdayasnian village, and for
a succor even with my wants, for a succor with salutations of
salvation, and for one with praises, O Fire! and for thee, O Ahurian
one of Ahura! do I ask the fullest Yasht.

15. And I pray for (?) Raman Hvastra for this Province, and for
healthfulness and healing. And I pray for it with my blessing
for you pious men, for all. And I pray for him who is saintly
with (true) goodness, whosoever he may be, between heaven and
the earth, for a thousand healing remedies, and for ten thousand
of the same.

16-19. (See Y8.5-8.)

20. Thus may it happen as I pray. 21. And by this may I gain (that)
blessing, the good Blessedness (our sanctity rewarded). And we
address, and we invoke religious zeal and capability, and the
waters with our Yasna thus: O ye good waters! since (they are)
yours, do ye, as you are asked, grant splendor and grant glory,
ye who are well able so to give; and do ye, O ye waters! grant
(once more) that helpful blessing which was gained from you of
old!

22. Praise (be) to Ahura Mazda, and to the Bountiful Immortals.
Praise (be) to Mithra of the wide pastures. Praise to the fleet-horsed
sun. Praise to (the star which so we name, and with this sun)
Ahura Mazda's eyes. Praise to the Kine (the herds of blessed gift).
Praise to Gaya (Maretan) [Gayomard] and to the Fravashi of Zarathushtra (first
of) saints; yea, praise to the entire creation of the holy (and
the clean), to those now living, and to those just passing into
life, and to those of days to come 23. And do Thou then Ahura,
as in answer to these our prayers and songs of praise, cause us
to prosper to salvation through Thy Good Mind, the Sovereign Power,
and Thy Righteous Order (in Thy ritual and law)!
