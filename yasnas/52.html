<h4>A PRAYER FOR SANCTITY AND ITS BENEFITS.</h4>

  + NOTE:  Translated by L. H. Mills (From <i>Sacred Books of the East</i>,
  American Edition, 1898.)

1. I pray with benedictions for a benefit, and for the good,
even for the entire creation of the holy (and the clean); I beseech
for them for the (generation which is) now alive, for that which
is just coming into life, and for that which shall be hereafter.
And (I pray for that) sanctity which leads to prosperity, and
which has long afforded shelter, which goes on hand in hand with
it, which joins it in its walk, and of itself becoming its close
companion as it delivers forth its precepts, (2) bearing every
form of healing virtue which comes to us in waters, appertains
to cattle, or is found in plants, and overwhelming, all the harmful
malice of the Daevas, (and their servants) who might harm this
dwelling and its lord, (3) bringing good gifts, and better blessings,
given very early, and later (gifts), leading to successes, and
for a long time giving shelter. And so the greatest, and the best,
and most beautiful benefits of sanctity fall likewise to our lot
(4) for the sacrifice, homage, propitiation, and the praise of
the Bountiful Immortals, for the bringing prosperity to this abode,
and for the prosperity of the entire creation of the holy, and
the clean, (and as for this, so) for the opposition of the entire
evil creation. (And I pray for this) as I praise through Righteousness,
I who am beneficent, those who are (likewise of a better mind).
