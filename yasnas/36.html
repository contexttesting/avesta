<h4>TO AHURA AND THE FIRE.</h4>

1. We would approach You two, O (Ye) primeval ones in the house
of this Thy holy Fire, O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit!
Who brings pollutions to this (Thy flame) him wilt Thou cover
with pollutions (in his turn). 2. But as the most friendly do
Thou give us zeal, O Fire of the Lord! and approach us, and with
the loving blessing of the most friendly, with the praise of the
most adored. Yea, may'st thou approach to aid us in this our greatest
(undertaking) among the efforts of our zeal.

3. The Fire of Ahura Mazda art thou verily; yea, the most bounteous
one of His Spirit, wherefore Thine is the most potent of all names
(for grace), O Fire of the Lord! 4. And therefore we would approach
Thee, (O Ahura!) with the help of Thy Good Mind (which Thou dost
implant within us), with Thy (good) Righteousness, and with the
actions and the words inculcated by Thy good wisdom!

5. We therefore bow before Thee, and we direct our prayers to
Thee with confessions of our guilt, O Ahura Mazda! with all the
good thoughts (which Thou dost inspire), with all the words well
said, and the deeds well done, with these would we approach Thee.
6. And to Thy most beauteous body do we make our deep acknowledgments,
O Ahura Mazda! to those stars (which are Thy body); and to that
one, the highest of the high, [such as the sun was called]!
