<h4>PRAYERS FOR THE DWELLING OF THE SACRIFICER.</h4>

1. Thus that better than the good may he approach, who shows
to us straight paths of profit appertaining to this bodily life
and to the mental likewise, in the eternal (?) realms where dwells
Ahura; yea, may he approach it, who is Thy worthy servant, and
good citizen, O Great giver Lord!

2. May these blessings approach this house, which are the wise
perceptions of the saints, the sacred blessings bestowed through
the ritual, their guileless characteristics, together with their
recognition of what is due; and may the Righteous Order appear
for this village, and the Divine Sovereign Power, together with
the benefit and glorious welfare (which ensues),

3. And with these the long enduring prominence of this Religion
of Ahura's, the Zarathushtrian Faith. And may the Kine be now
with greatest speed within (the farm-yard of) this house, most
speedily may the rewarded sanctity and the strength of the holy
man be here, most speedily as well Ahura's lore. 4. And may the
good and heroic and bountiful Fravashis of the saints come here,
and may they go hand in hand with us with the healing virtues
of (their) blessed gifts as wide-spread as the earth, as far-spread
as the rivers, as high-reaching as the sun, for the furtherance
of the better men, for the hindrance of the hostile, and for the
abundant growth of riches and of glory.

5. May Sraosha (Obedience) conquer disobedience within this house,
and may peace triumph over discord here, and generous giving over
avarice, reverence over contempt, speech with truthful words over
lying utterance. May the Righteous Order gain the victory over
the Demon of the Lie.

6. As in this (house) the Bountiful Immortals seek for good Yasnas
and good praises from the blessed Sraosha (who governs here),
and as they seek for (one) good sacrifice and act of homage (more
especially their own) which is a good offering (to them) for (our)
salvation, and a good offering in praise, together with a long
continued offering of the entire self, (7) let not then (their)
brilliant glory ever desert this house, nor the bright abundance,
nor an illustrious offspring legitimately born, nor that long
continued companionship which is the furtherance of that good
blessedness which teaches concerning glory.

8-10. (= Y8.5-7).

11. In order that our minds may be delighted, and our souls the
best, let our bodies be glorified as well, and let them; O Mazda!
go likewise openly (unto Heaven) as the best world of the saints
as devoted to Ahura, (12) and accompanied by Asha Vahishta (who
is Righteousness the Best), and the most beautiful! And may we
see Thee, and may we, approaching, come around about Thee, and
attain to entire companionship with Thee! And we sacrifice to
the Righteous Order, the best, the most beautiful, the bounteous
Immortal!
