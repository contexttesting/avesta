<h4>A PRAYER TO AHURA AS THE KING, THE LIFE, AND THE REWARDER.</h4>

1. Praises, and songs, and adorations do we offer to Ahura Mazda,
and to Righteousness the Best; yea, we offer and we ascribe them,
and proclaim them. 2. And to Thy good Kingdom, O Ahura Mazda!
may we attain for ever, and a good King be Thou over us; and let
each man of us, and so each woman, thus abide, O Thou most beneficent
of beings, and for both the worlds! 3. Thus do we render Thee.
the helpful Yazad, endowed with good devices, the friend of them
(who worship Thee) with (well-adjusted) ritual; so may'st Thou
be to us our life, and our body's vigor, O Thou most beneficent
of beings, and that for both the worlds!

4. Aye, let us win and conquer (?) long life, O Ahura Mazda!
in Thy grace, and through Thy will may we be powerful. May'st
Thou lay hold on us to help, and long, and with salvation, O Thou
most beneficent of beings!

5. Thy praisers and Mathra-speakers may we be called, O Ahura
Mazda! so do we wish, and to this may we attain. What reward most
meet for our deserving Thou hast appointed for the souls, O Ahura
Mazda! (6) of that do Thou bestow on us for this life, and for
that of mind. Of that reward (do Thou Thyself grant this advantage),
that we may come under Thy protecting guardianship, and that of
Righteousness for ever. We sacrifice to that brave Yasna, the
Yasna Haptanghaiti, the holy, the ritual chief!
