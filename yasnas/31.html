1. Mindful of your commands, we proclaim words unpleasant for
them to hear that after the commands of the Lie destroy the creatures
of Right, but most welcome to those that give their heart to Mazda.

2. If by reason of these things the better path is not in sight
for choosing, then will I come to you all as judge of the parties
twain whom Ahura Mazda knoweth, that we may live according to
the Right.

3. What award Thou givest through the (holy) Spirit and through
the Fire and hast taught through Asha, to both the parties, and
what the decision is for the wise, this do Thou tell us, Mazda,
that we may know, even with the tongue of Thine own mouth, that
I may convert all living men.

4. If Asha is to be invoked and Mazda and the other Ahuras and
Ashi and Armaiti, do thou seek for me, O Vohu Manah,<sup>1</sup> the mighty
Dominion, by the increase of which we might vanquish the Lie.

   + NOTE: 1. Boyce: "seek by the best purpose (vahishta manah)..."
  This is an excellent example of the continuous juxtaposition in the Gathas
  of the Amesha Spentas as divinities and things.]


5. Tell me therefore what ye, O thou Right, have appointed me
as the better portion, for me to determine, to know and to keep
in mind, O thou Good Thought — which portion they envy me. Tell
me of all these things. O Mazda Ahura, that shall not or shall
be.

6. To him shall the best befall, who, as one that knows, speaks
to me Right's truthful word of Welfare and of Immortality; even
the Dominion of Mazda which Good Thought shall increase for him.

7. About which he in the beginning thus thought, "let the
blessed realms be filled with Light", he it is that by his
wisdom created Right. (Those realms) that the Best Thought shall
possess those dost Thou exalt, O Mazda, through the Spirit, which,
O Ahura, is ever the same.

8. I recognize Thee, O Mazda, in my thought, that Thou the First
art (also) the Last — that Thou art Father of Vohu Manah; --
when I apprehend Thee with mine eye, that Thou art the true Creator
of Right [Asha], and art the Lord to judge the actions of life.

9. Thine was Armaiti, Thine the Ox-Creator, (namely) the Wisdom
of the Spirit, O Mazda Ahura, because Thou didst give (the cattle)
choice whether to depend on a husbandman or one who is no husbandman.

10. So she chose for herself out of the two the cattle-tending
husbandman as her lord to guard the Right, the man that advances
Good Thought. He that is no-husbandman, O Mazda, however eager
he be, has no part in this good message.

11. When Thou, O Mazda, in the beginning didst create the Individual
and the Individuality, through Thy Spirit, and powers of understanding
- when Thou didst make life clothed with the body, when (Thou
madest) actions and teachings, whereby one may exercise one's
convictions at one's free-will;

12. Then lifts up his voice the false speaker or the true speaker,
he that knows or he that knows not, (each) according to his own
heart and mind. Passing from one to another Armaiti confers with
the spirit in whom there is wavering.

13. Whatever open or whatever secret (acts) may be visited with
punishment, or whether a person for a little sin demands the highest
punishment, — of all this through Asha Thou art aware, observing
it with Thy flashing eye.

14. These things I ask Thee, O Ahura, how will these come and
happen — the dues, that in accord with the records are appointed
for the righteous, and those, O Mazda, for the followers of the
Druj, — how shall these be when they come to the reckoning.

15. This I ask, what penalty is for him who seeks to achieve kingdom
for a liar, for a man of ill deeds, O Ahura, who finds not his
living without injury to the husbandman's cattle and men, though
he does him no injury.

16. This I ask, whether the understanding man, who strives to
advance the Dominion over the house, or district, or land through
Asha, shall become like Thee, O Mazda Ahura, when will he be and
how will he act?

17. Which is the greater — what the follower of Asha or what
the follower of Druj believe? Let him that knows inform the wise;
no longer let him that knows nothing deceive. Be to us, O Mazda
Ahura, the Teacher of Good Thought.

18. Let none of you listen to the words and commands of the follower
of the Druj; for he brings house and clan and district and land
into misery and destruction. Resist them with weapon!

19. To him should we listen who has understood Asha, to the wise
Healer of Life O Ahura, who can or will establish the truth of
the words of his tongue, when through Thy red Fire, O Mazda, the
assignment (of rewards) is made to the two parties.

20. Whosoever cometh over to the Righteous, far from him hereafter
shall be long age of misery (and) darkness, ill-food, and crying
of woe. To such an existence, ye followers of the Lie, shall your
own Self bring you through your (own) action.

21. Mazda Ahura by virtue of His absolute Lordship will grant
a perpetuity of communion with Haurvatat and Ameretat, and with
Asha, with Khshathra, and with Vohu Manah, to him that in spirit
and in action is his friend.

22. Clear it is to the man of understanding, as one who has realized
it with his thought. He upholds Asha together with good Dominion
by his word and deed. He will be, O Mazda Ahura, the most helpful
helper to Thee.
