1. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - as to prayer, how
it should be to one of you. O Mazda Ahura, might one like thee
teach to a friend such as I am, and through friendly Right give
us support, that Good Thought may come to us.

2. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether at the beginning
of the Best Existence the recompenses shall bring blessedness
to him that meets with them. Surely he, O Right, the holy one,
who watches in his spirit the transgression of all, if himself
the benefactor of all that lives, O Mazda.

3. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who is by generation
the Father of Right, at the first? Who determined the path of
sun and stars? Who is it by whom the moon waxes and wanes again?
This, O Mazda, and yet more, I am fain to know.

4. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who upholds the earth
beneath and the firmament from falling? Who the waters and the
plants? Who yoked swiftness to winds and clouds? Who is, O Mazda,
creator of Good Thought?

5. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. What artist made light
and darkness? What artist made sleep and waking? Who made morning,
noon, and night, that call the understanding man to his duty?

6. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether what I proclaim
is verily the truth. Will Right with its actions give aid (at
the last)? will Piety? Will Good Thought announce from the Dominion?
For whom hast thou made the pregnant cow that brings good luck?

7. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who created together
with Dominion the precious Piety? Who made by wisdom the son obedient
to his father? I strive to recognize by these things thee, O Mazda,
creator of all things through the holy spirit.

8. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. I could keep in mind
thy design, O Mazda, and understand aright the maxims of life
which I ask of Good Thought and Right. How will my soul partake
of the good that gives increase?

9. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether for the Self
that I would bring to perfection, that of the man of insight,
the Lord of Dominion would make promises of the sure Dominion,
one of thy likenesses, O Mazda, who dwells in one abode with (Right)
and Good Thought.

10. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. The Religion which
is best for (all) that are, which in union with Right should prosper
all that is mine, will they duly observe it, the religion of my
creed, with words and action of Piety, in desire for thy (future)
good things, O Mazda?

11. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether Piety will
extend to those to whom thy Religion shall be proclaimed? I was
ordained at the first for this by thee; all others I look upon
with hatred of spirit.

12. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who among those with
whom I would speak is a righteous man, and who a liar? On which
side is the enemy? (On this), or is he the enemy, the Liar who
opposes thy blessings? How shall it be with him? Is he not to
be thought of as an enemy?

13. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether we shall drive
the Lie away from us to those who being full of disobedience will
not strive after fellowship with Right, nor trouble themselves
with counsel of Good Thought.

14. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether I would put
the Lie into the hands of Right, to cast her down by the words
of thy lore, to work a mighty destruction among the Liars, to
bring torments upon them and enmities, O Mazda.

15. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - if thou hast power
over this to ward off from me through Right, when the two opposing
hosts meet in battle according to those decrees which thou wilt
firmly establish. Whether is it of the twain that thou wilt give
victory.

16. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. Who is victorious to
protect by thy doctrine (all) that are? By vision assure me how
to set up the judge that heals the world. Then let him have Obedience
coming with Good Thought unto every man whom thou desirest, O
Mazda.

17. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether through you
I shall attain my goal, O Mazda, even attachment unto you, and
that my voice may be effectual, that Welfare and Immortality may
be ready to unite according to that promise with him who joins
himself with Right.

18. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura - whether I shall indeed,
O Right, earn the reward, even ten mares with a stallion and a
camel, which was promised to me, O Mazda, as well as through thee,
the future gift of Welfare and Immortality.

19. This I ask Thee, tell me truly, Ahura. He that will not give
the reward to him that earns it, even to the man who fulfilling
his word gives him (what he undertook) - what penalty shall come
to him for the same at the present? I know that which shall come
to him at the last.

20. Have the Daevas ever exercised good dominion? And I ask of
those who see how for the Daevas' sake the Karapan and the Usij
give cattle to violence, and how the Kavi made them continually
to mourn, instead of taking care that they make the pastures prosper
through Right.
