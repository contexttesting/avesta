. The Zoroastrian Creed

  This creed probably dates
  to the earliest days of the faith, but seems to have undergone
  some linguistic shift and subsequent recasting in the Old Avestan
  dialect. It was probably intended to be recited before an open
  assembly. See discussion in Boyce, <i>Zoroastrianism
  - Its Antiquity and Constant Vigour,</i> (Costa Mesa, Mazda Pub, 1992, p. 84 and 10. ff). The last phrase of verse 7, plus all of verses 8 and 9, are
  incorporated into the daily <a href="../ritual/ritualk.htm">Kusti ritual</a>.


1. I curse the Daevas.
I declare myself a Mazda-worshipper, a supporter of Zarathushtra,
hostile to the Daevas, fond of Ahura's teaching, a praiser of
the Amesha Spentas, a worshipper of the Amesha Spentas. I ascribe
all good to Ahura Mazda, 'and all the best,' Asha-endowed,
splendid, xwarena-endowed, whose is the cow, whose is Asha, whose
is the light, 'may whose blissful areas be filled with light'.

2. I choose the good Spenta Armaiti for myself; let her be mine.
I renounce the theft and robbery of the cow, and the damaging
and plundering of the Mazdayasnian settlements.

3. I want freedom of movement and freedom of dwelling for those
with homesteads, to those who dwell upon this earth with their
cattle. With reverence for Asha, and (offerings) offered up, I
vow this: I shall nevermore damage or plunder the Mazdayasnian
settlements, even if I have to risk life and limb.

4. I reject the authority of the Daevas, the wicked, no-good,
lawless, evil-knowing, the most druj-like of beings, the foulest
of beings, the most damaging of beings. I reject the Daevas and
their comrades, I reject the demons (yatu) and their comrades;
I reject any who harm beings. I reject them with my thoughts,
words, and deeds. I reject them publicly.

 Even as I reject the head (authorities), so too do I reject
the hostile followers of the druj.

5. As Ahura Mazda taught Zarathushtra at all discussions, at
all meetings, at which Mazda and Zarathushtra conversed;

6. as Ahura Mazda taught Zarathushtra at all discussions, at
all meetings, at which Mazda and Zarathushtra conversed — even
as Zarathushtra rejected the authority of the Daevas, so I also
reject, as Mazda-worshipper and supporter of Zarathushtra, the
authority of the Daevas, even as he, the Asha-endowed Zarathushtra,
has rejected them.

7. As the belief of the waters, the belief of the plants, the
belief of the well-made (Original) Cow; as the belief of Ahura
Mazda who created the cow and the Asha-endowed Man; as the belief
of Zarathushtra, the belief of Kavi Vishtaspa, the belief of both
Frashaostra and Jamaspa; as the belief of each of the Saoshyants
(saviors) — fulfilling destiny and Asha-endowed —

so I am a Mazda-worshipper
of this belief and teaching.

8. I profess myself a Mazda-worshipper, a Zoroastrian, having
vowed it and professed it. I pledge myself to the well-thought
thought, I pledge myself to the well-spoken word, I pledge myself
to the well-done action.

9. I pledge myself to the Mazdayasnian religion, which causes
the attack to be put off and weapons put down; [which upholds khvaetvadatha],
Asha-endowed; which of all religions that exist or shall be, is the greatest,
the best, and the most beautiful: Ahuric, Zoroastrian. I ascribe all good to
Ahura Mazda.
This is the creed of the Mazdayasnian religion.
