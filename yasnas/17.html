1-10. (See <a href="#y6">Y6</a>, which is nearly identical with verses 1-10.)

11. We worship thee, the Fire, O Ahura Mazda's son! We worship
the fire Berezi-savangha (of the lofty use), and the fire Vohu-fryana
(the good and friendly), and the fire Urvazishta (the most beneficial
and most helpful), and the fire Vazishta (the most supporting),
and the fire Spenishta (the most bountiful), and Nairya-sangha
the Yazad of the royal lineage, and that fire which is the house-lord
of all houses and Mazda-made, even the son of Ahura Mazda, the
holy lord of the ritual order, with all the fires.

12. And we worship the good and best waters Mazda-made, holy,
all the waters Mazda-made and holy, and all the plants which Mazda
made, and which are holy.

13. And we worship the Mathra-spenta (the bounteous word-of-reason),
the Zarathushtrian law against the Daevas, and its long descent.

14. And we worship Mount Ushi-darena which is Mazda-made and shining
with its holiness, and all the mountains shining with holiness,
and of abundant glory, and which Mazda made ---.

15. And we worship the good and pious prayer for blessings, (16)
and these waters and (these lands), (17) and all the greatest
chieftains, lords of the ritual order;

18. And I praise, invoke, and glorify the good, heroic, bountiful
Fravashis of the saints, those of the house, the Vis, the Zantuma,
the Dahvyuma, and the Zarathushtrotema, and all the holy Yazads!
