+ NOTE: THE SACRIFICE CONTINUES.

1. With the Baresman brought hither together with the Zaothra,
for the worship of the Creator Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the
glorious, and for that of the Bountiful Immortals, I desire to
approach this Haoma with my praise, offered (as it is) with punctilious
sanctity (or, for a blessing), and this fresh milk, and this plant
Hadhanaepata. 2. And, as an act of worship to the beneficent waters,
I desire to approach these Zaothras with (my) praise offered (as
they are) with punctilious sanctity, having the Haoma with them,
and the flesh, with the Hadhanaepata. And I desire to approach
the Haoma-water with my praise for the beneficent waters; and
I desire to approach the stone mortar and the iron mortar with
my praise. 3. And I desire to approach this plant for the Baresman
with my praise, and the well-timed prayer for blessings, that
which has approached (to accept our homage), and the memorized
recital and the fulfillment of the good Mazdayasnian Faith, and
the heard recital of the Gathas, and the well-timed and successful
prayer for blessings, that of the holy lord of the ritual order.
And I desire to approach these wood-billets and their perfume
with my praise, - thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son! Yea,
I desire to approach all good things with my praise, those which
Mazda made, and which have the seed of sanctity (within them),
(4) for the propitiation of Ahura Mazda and of the Bountiful Immortals,
and of Sraosha the blessed, and of Ahura Mazda's Fire, the lofty
ritual lord!

(=Y3.5-19; 20-23=Y3.1-4)

20. And I desire to approach this Haoma with (my) praise, that
which is thus lifted up with sanctity, and this milk (fresh as
it is, and as if) living and lifted up with sanctity, and this
plant the Hadhanaepata lifted up with sanctity. 21. And I desire
to approach these Zaothras with (my) praise for the beneficial
waters, these Zaothras which have the Haoma with them and the
milk with them, and the Hadhanaepata, and which are lifted up
with sanctity. And I desire to approach the Haoma-water with (my)
praise for the beneficial waters, and the two mortars, the stone
one and the iron one, (22) and I desire to, approach this branch
for the Baresman with my praise, and the memorized recital and
fulfillment of the Mazdayasnian law, and the heard recital of
the Gathas, and the well-timed and persistent prayer for blessings(uttered)
by the holy lords of the ritual order, and this wood and perfume,
even thine, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's son, and all good objects Mazda-made
(23) for the propitiation of Ahura Mazda, the resplendent, the
glorious, and of the Bountiful Immortals, and of Mithra of the
wide pastures, and of Raman Hvastra, (24) and of the resplendent
sun, immortal, radiant, of the fleet horses, and of Vayu, (of
predominant influence and) working on high, set over the other
beings in the creation [(Pazand); that is for thee thus (O Vayu)
when thine influence is that which appertains to Spenta Mainyu],
and for the propitiation of the most just knowledge Mazda-given,
and of the holy and good Religion, the Mazdayasnian Faith; (25)
for the propitiation of the Mathra Spenta, (the bounteous) and
holy, and the effective, instituted against the Daevas, the Zarathushtrian
law, and of the long descent of the good Mazdayasnian Faith [the
holding in mind and devotion to the Mathra Spenta, and knowledge
of the Mazdayasnian Religion] for the propitiation of the understanding
which is innate and Mazda-made, and of that which is heard by
the ear; (26) and for thy propitiation, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's
son! [(Pazand); (yea) thine, the Fire's, O Ahura Mazda's son]
with all the fires, and for the propitiation of Mount Ushi-darena,
the Mazda-made, radiant with sanctity; (27) and of all the holy
Yazads, spiritual and earthly, and of the holy Fravashis, the
redoubted and overwhelming, those of the ancient lore, and those
of the next of kin and of the Yazad of the spoken name!
