1. Now I will proclaim to those who will hear the things that
the understanding man should remember, for hymns unto Ahura and
prayers to Good Thought; also the felicity that is with the heavenly
lights, which through Right shall be beheld by him who wisely
thinks.

2. Hear with your ears the best things; look upon them with clear-seeing
thought, for decision between the two Beliefs, each man for himself
before the Great consummation, bethinking you that it be accomplished
to our pleasure.

3. Now the two primal Spirits, who reveal themselves in vision
as Twins, are the Better and the Bad, in thought and word and
action. And between these two the wise ones chose aright, the
foolish not so.

4. And when these twain Spirits came together in the beginning,
they created Life and Not-Life, and that at the last Worst Existence
shall be to the followers of the Lie, but the Best Existence to
him that follows Right.

5. Of these twain Spirits he that followed the Lie chose doing
the worst things; the holiest Spirit chose Right, he that clothes
him with the massy heavens as a garment. So likewise they that
are fain to please Ahura Mazda by dutiful actions.

6. Between these twain the Daevas also chose not aright, for
infatuation came upon them as they took counsel together, so that
they chose the Worst Thought. Then they rushed together to Violence,
that they might enfeeble the world of men.

7. And to him (i.e. mankind) came Dominion, and Good Mind, and
Right and Piety gave continued life to their bodies and indestructibility,
so that by thy retributions through (molten) metal he may gain
the prize over the others.

8. So when there cometh their punishment for their sins, then,
O Mazda, at Thy command shall Good Thought establish the Dominion
in the Consummation, for those who deliver the Lie, O Ahura, into
the hands of Right.

9. So may we be those that make this world advance, O Mazda and
ye other Ahuras, come hither, vouchsafing (to us) admission into
your company and Asha, in order that (our) thought may gather
together while reason is still shaky.

10. Then truly on the (world of) Lie shall come the destruction
of delight; but they who get themselves good name shall be partakers
in the promised reward in the fair abode of Good Thought, of Mazda,
and of Right.

11. If, O ye mortals, ye mark those commandments which Mazda hath
ordained â€” of happiness and pain, the long punishment for the
follower of the Druj, and blessings for the followers of the Right
-- then hereafter shall it be well.
