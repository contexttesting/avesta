+ NOTE: ZAND OR COMMENTARY ON THE AHUNA-VAIRYA FORMULAS.


(As the Ahu is excellent, so (is) the Ratu (one who rules)
from the righteous Order, a creator of mental goodness and of
life's actions done for Mazda; and the Kingdom (is) for Ahura
which to the poor shall offer a nurturer.)

1. Zarathushtra asked of Ahura Mazda: O Ahura Mazda, Thou most
bounteous Spirit! maker of the corporeal worlds, the holy One!
which was that word which Thou did'st declare to me, (2) which
was before the sky, and before the water, before the earth, and
before the cattle, before the plants, and before the fire, and
before the holy man, and the Demon-gods (the Daevas), before the
Khrafstra-men, and before all the incarnate world; even before
all the good creatures made by Mazda, and which contain (and are)
the seed of righteousness?

3. Thereupon Ahura Mazda said: It was this piece, the Ahuna-vairya,
O Spitama Zarathushtra! which I pronounced as thine (4) before
the sky, and before the waters, before the land, and before the
cattle and the plants, and before the fire, Ahura Mazda's son,
before the holy man, and before the Daevas, and Khrafstra-men,
and before the entire corporeal world, even before the good creatures
made by Mazda, which contain (and are) the seed of righteousness.

5. It was these part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya, O Spitama Zarathushtra!
which especially belongs to me, and when each is intoned aloud
without the (needless) repetition of verses and of words, and
without their omission, it is worth a hundred of their other stanzas,
even although they are prominent in the ritual, and likewise equally
as well recited without additions or omissions; nay, further,
when it is intoned imperfectly but added to, and with omissions,
it is even then in effect equivalent (not to a hundred indeed,
but) to ten other (stanzas) that are prominent.

6. And whoever in this world of mine which is corporeal shall
mentally recall, O Spitama* Zarathushtra! a portion of the Ahuna-vairya,
and having thus recalled it, shall undertone it, or beginning
to recite it with the undertone, shall then utter it aloud, or
chanting it with intoning voice, shall worship thus, then with
even threefold (safety and with speed) I will bring his soul over
the Bridge of Chinvat, I who am Ahura Mazda (I will help him to
pass over it) to Heaven (the best life), and to Righteousness
the Best, and to the lights of heaven.

7. And whoever, O Spitama Zarathushtra! while undertoning the
part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya (or this piece the Ahuna-vairya),
takes ought therefrom, whether the half, or the third, or the
fourth, or the fifth, I who am Ahura Mazda will draw his soul
off from the better world; yea, so far off will I withdraw it
as the earth is large and wide; [and this earth is as long as
it is broad].

8. And I pronounced this saying which contains its Ahu and its
Ratu before the creation of this heaven, before the making of
the waters, and the plants, and the four-footed kine, before the
birth of the holy biped man, before this sun with its body made
for the acquisition of the creation of the Bountiful Immortals.

9. And the more bountiful of the two Spirits (Ahura) declared
to me (Zarathushtra) the entire creation of the pure, that which
exists at present, that which is in the course of emerging into
existence, and that which shall be, with reference to the performance
and realization 'of the actions of a life devoted to Mazda.'

10. And this word is the most emphatic of the words which have
ever been pronounced, or which are now spoken, or which shall
be spoken in future; for (the eminence of) this utterance is a
thing of such a nature, that if all the corporeal and living world
should learn it, and learning should hold fast by it, they would
be redeemed from their mortality!

11. And this our word I have proclaimed as a symbol to be learned,
and to be recited, as it were, to every one of the beings under
the influence of and for the sake of Righteousness the Best.

12. And 'as' (the worshipper has) here spoken it forth, when he
has thus 'appointed' the 'Lord and regulator,' so (by thus reciting
these authoritative words), he acknowledges Ahura Mazda (as prior
to, and supreme) over, those creatures who have 'the mind' as
their first. 'As' he acknowledges Him as the greatest of them
all, 'so' he assigns the creatures to Him (as to their originator).

13. As he undertones the third sentence, he thereby announces
that 'all the amenities of life appertain to the 'good' Mazda,
(and come) from Him. As he recites 'dazda manangho,' 'the creator
of mind,' he acknowledges Him as superior and prior to mind; and
as he makes Him the one who indicates (the truth) to mind, (saying)
'manangho of mind,' which means that by this much he makes Him
(its director), and then he makes Him 'the lord of actions.'

14. And when he acknowledges Him for the creatures thus, 'O Mazda!'
he acknowledges Him (as their ruler) when he assigns the creatures
to Him thus. He then assigns the Kingdom to Ahura, saying: 'Thine,
O Mazda! is the Kingdom.' And he assigns a nourisher and protector
to the poor, saying: Yim drigubyo dadat vastarem; that is, as
a friend to Spitama. This is the fifth sentence, (and it concludes)
the entire recital and word, (even) the whole of this word of
Ahura Mazda.

15. He who is the best (of all) Ahura Mazda, pronounced the Ahuna-vairya,
and as He pronounced it as the best, so He caused it to have its
effect, (He, ever) the same, (as He is).
The evil one at once arose (to oppose Him), but He (Ahura) repelled
that wicked one with His interdict, and with this repelling renunciation:
Neither our minds are in harmony, nor our precepts, nor our comprehensions,
nor our beliefs, nor our words, nor our actions, nor our consciences,
nor our souls!

  + NOTE:  <h3>CATECHETICAL ZAND.</h3>


16. And this saying, uttered by Mazda, has three stages, or measures,
and belongs to four classes (of men as its supporters), and to
five chiefs (in the political world, without whom its efficiency
is marred), and it has a conclusion ending with a gift. (Question.)
How are its measures (constituted)? (Answer.) The good thought,
the good word, and the good deed. 17. (Question.) With what classes
of men? (Answer.) The priest, the charioteer (as the chief of
warriors), the systematic tiller of the ground, and the artisan.
These classes therefore accompany the religious man throughout
his entire duty with the correct thought, the truthful word, and
the righteous action. These are the classes and states in life
which give attention to the rulers, and fulfill the (laws) of
religion; (yea, they are the guides and companions of that religious
man) through whose actions the settlements are furthered in righteousness.

18. (Question.) How are the chiefs (constituted)? (Answer.) They
are the house-chief, the village-chief, and the tribe-chief, the
chief of the province, and the Zarathushtra as the fifth. That
is, so far as those provinces are concerned which are different
from, and outside of the Zarathushtrian regency, or domain. [Ragha
which has four chiefs (only) is the Zarathushtrian (district)]
(Question.) How are the chiefs of this one constituted? (Answer.)
They (are) the house-chief, the village-chief, the tribe-chief,
and the Zarathushtra as the fourth. 19. (Question.) What is the
thought well thought? (Answer.) (It is that which the holy man
thinks), the one who holds the holy thought to be before all other
things (Question.) What is the word well spoken? (Answer.) It
is the Mathra Spenta, the bounteous word of reason. (Question.)
What is the deed well done? (Answer.) It is that done with praises,
and by the creatures who regard Righteousness as before all other
things. 20. (Question.) Mazda made a proclamation, whom did He
announce? (Answer.) Some one who was holy, and yet both heavenly
and mundane. (Question.) What was His character, He who made this
sacred enunciation? (Answer.) He who is the best (of all), the
ruling one. (Question.) Of what character (did He proclaim him
the coming one)? (Answer.) As holy and the best, a ruler who exercises
no wanton or despotic power.

21. We sacrifice to the (several) part(s) of the Ahuna-vairya.
We sacrifice to the memorized recital of the Ahuna-vairya, and
its regular chanting and its use in the full Yasna.
