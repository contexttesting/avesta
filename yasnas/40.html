<h4>PRAYERS FOR HELPERS.</h4>

1. And now in these Thy dispensations, O Ahura Mazda! do Thou
wisely act for us, and with abundance with Thy bounty and Thy
tenderness as touching us; and grant that reward which Thou hast
appointed to our souls, O Ahura Mazda! 2. Of this do Thou Thyself
bestow upon us for this world and the spiritual; and now as part
thereof (do Thou grant) that we may attain to fellowship with
Thee, and Thy Righteousness for all duration.

3. And do Thou grant us, O Ahura! men who are righteous, and
both lovers and producers of the Right as well. And give us trained
beasts for the pastures, broken in for riding, and for bearing,
(that they may be) in helpful companionship with us, and as a
source of long enduring vigor, and a means of rejoicing grace
to us for this.

4. So let there be a kinsman lord for us, with the laborers of
the village, and so likewise let there be the clients (or the
peers). And by the help of those may we arise.
So may we be to You, O Mazda Ahura! holy and true, and with free
giving of our gifts.
