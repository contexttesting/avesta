<h4>TO ARDVI SURA ANAHITA, AND THE WATERS.</h4>

1. I will praise the water Ardvi Sura Anahita, the wide-flowing
(as it is) and healing in its influence, efficacious against the
Daevas, devoted to Ahura's lore, and to be worshipped with sacrifice
within the corporeal world, furthering all living things (?) and
holy, helping on the increase and improvement of our herds and
settlements, holy, and increasing our wealth, holy, and helping
on the progress of the Province, holy (as she is)? 2. (Ardvi Sura
Anahita) who purifies the seed of all male beings, who sanctifies
the wombs of all women to the birth, who makes all women fortunate
in labor, who brings all women a regular and timely flow of milk,
(3) (Ardvi Sura Anahita) with a volume sounding from afar, which
is alone equal in its bulk to all the waters which flow forth
upon earth, which flows down with mighty volume from high Hukairya
to the sea Vouru-kasha. 4. And all the gulfs in Vouru-kasha are
stirred (when it falls down), all the middle doth well up when
Ardvi Sura Anahita rushes in, when she plunges foaming into them,
she, whose are a thousand tributaries, and a thousand outlets,
and each as it flows in, or rushes out, is a forty days' ride
in length to a rider mounted well.

5. And the (chief) outlet to this one water (Ardvi Sura Anahita)
goes apart, dividing to all the seven Karshvars. And this outlet
to my river, Ardvi Sura Anahita, bears off its water always in
summer and in winter. This my river purifies the seed of men,
and wombs of women, and women's milk.

6. Let the saints' Fravashis now draw near, those of the saints
who live, or have lived, of those born, or yet to be born; yea,
let them come near which have borne these waters up stream from
the nearest ones (that lie below as the outlet pours away) 7.
Let not our waters be for the man of ill intent, of evil speech,
or deeds, or conscience; let them not be for the offender of a
friend, not for an insulter of a Magian, nor for one who harms
the workmen, nor for one who hates his kindred. And let not our
good waters (which are not only good, but) best, and Mazda-made,
help on the man who strives to mar our settlements which are not
to be corrupted, nor him who would mar our bodies, (our) uncorrupted
(selves), (8) nor the thief, or bludgeon-bearing ruffian who would
slaughter the disciples, nor a sorcerer, nor a burrier of dead
bodies, nor the jealous, nor the niggard, nor the godless heretic
who slays disciples, nor the evil tyrant among men. Against these
may our waters come as torments. As destructive may these come
(?), may they come to him who has done those first (foul evils),
as to him who does the last.

9. O waters! rest still within your places while the invoking
priest shall offer.
Shall not the invoker make offering to these good waters, and
with the inculcated words? (And how shall this be done?) Shall
he not be tongue-fettered, if he offers else than with the ritual?
Shall (not) the words be so delivered as the Aethrapaiti teaches?
Where shall the blessings be (inserted)? Where the supplications
with confessions? Where the gifts of those that offer? 10. (It
shall be only thus) as Ahura Mazda showed before to Zarathushtra,
and as Zarathushtra taught the corporeal worlds (the men on earth)!
Thou shalt pray the first petition to the waters, O Zarathushtra,
and after that thou shalt offer the Zaothras to the waters, sanctified,
and sought out with pious care; and thou shalt pronounce these
words (as follows, thus): (11) O ye waters, I beseech of you this
favor; and grant ye me this great one in whose bestowal ye flow
down to me for the bettering (of my state), with a never-failing
truth. O ye waters, I beseech of you for wealth of many kinds
(which gives) power (to its holder), and for an offspring self-dependent
whom multitudes will bless, and for whose wasting, or defeat,
or death, or vengeful punishment, or overtaking, no one prays.

12. And this do I beseech of you, O waters, this, O ye lands,
and this, ye plants! This wealth and offspring I beseech of You,
O Ye Bountiful Immortals, who rule aright, who dispose (of all)
aright, O Ye good beings, male and female, givers of good things;
and this I beseech of you, O ye beneficent, mighty, and overwhelming
Fravashis of the saints, and this (of thee), O Mithra of the wide
pastures, and this of thee, O blest and stately Sraosha; and of
thee, O Rashnu the most just, and of thee, O Fire, Ahura Mazda's
son; and of thee, O lofty lord, the royal Apam-napat, of the fleet
horses; aye, of You all, ye Yazads, bestowers of the better gifts
and holy. 13. And this do ye therefore grant me, O ye holy waters,
and ye lands!

14. And grant me likewise what is still greater than this all,
and still better than this all, and more beautiful, and more exceeding
precious (and that is, Immortality and Welfare), O Ye Yazads,
holy and ruling mightily, and powerful at once, and grant it speedily
according to this Gathic (?) word: (Yea), by veritable grace let
that be done (?) for us which is most promotive of our weal. 15.
And according to this further word again: Grant me, Thou who art
maker of the Kine, the plants, and the waters, Immortality and
likewise Weal, O Ahura Mazda, Thou most bounteous Spirit. And
grant me these two eternal gifts through Thy Good Mind in the
doctrine.
